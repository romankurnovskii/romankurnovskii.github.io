[LeetCode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)

## Naive Solution

1. Traverse the linked list, adding each node's value to a Python list
2. sort that list
3. create a new linked list from the sorted values
4. return the head of this new list. 

This solution would have a time complexity of `O(n log n)` due to the sort operation and a space complexity of `O(n)` because of the extra list we're creating.


```python
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head):
        values = []

        node = head
        while node:
            values.append(node.val)
            node = node.next

        values.sort()

        # Create a new linked list from the sorted values
        node = head
        for val in values:
            node.val = val
            node = node.next

        return head
```

## Solution

Using the [Merge Sort algorithm](/en/tracks/algorithms-101/algorithms/#sort).

1. **Divide and Conquer:** Merge sort uses the divide and conquer strategy, where we continuously split the linked list in half until we have multiple sublists of length 1. A list of length 1 is technically always sorted.
2. **Merge Sublists:** Once we have the sorted sublists, we start merging them together in a manner that the resultant list is also sorted.

The trick to making this solution `O(1)` space complexity is to modify the existing nodes' next pointers to generate the sorted list, rather than creating new nodes.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        # Split the list into two halves
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # fast is either at the end of the list, or one before the end.
        start = slow.next
        slow.next = None  # break the list

        # Sort the two lists
        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(start)

        return self.merge(left, right)

    def merge(self, l1, l2):
        # Merge two sorted lists
        if not l1 or not l2:
            return l1 or l2
        if l1.val > l2.val:
            l1, l2 = l2, l1
        l1.next = self.merge(l1.next, l2)
        return l1
```
