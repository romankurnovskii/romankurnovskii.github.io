```python
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, sentence1: str, sentence2: str) -> bool:
        words1, words2 = sentence1.split(), sentence2.split()
        m, n = len(words1), len(words2)
        if m < n:
            words1, words2 = words2, words1
            m, n = n, m
        i = j = 0
        while i < n and words1[i] == words2[i]:
            i += 1
        while j < n and words1[m - 1 - j] == words2[n - 1 - j]:
            j += 1
        return i + j >= n
