[LeetCode problem 1959](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-space-wasted-with-k-resizing-operations/)

```python
class Solution:
    def minSpaceWastedKResizing(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        k += 1
        n = len(nums)
        g = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            s = mx = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                s += nums[j]
                mx = max(mx, nums[j])
                g[i][j] = mx * (j - i + 1) - s
        f = [[inf] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        f[0][0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                for h in range(i):
                    f[i][j] = min(f[i][j], f[h][j - 1] + g[h][i - 1])
        return f[-1][-1]
