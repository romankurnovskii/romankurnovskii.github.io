[LeetCode problem 1584](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def find(x: int) -> int:
            if p[x] != x:
                p[x] = find(p[x])
            return p[x]

        n = len(points)
        g = []
        for i, (x1, y1) in enumerate(points):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                t = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
                g.append((t, i, j))
        p = list(range(n))
        res = 0
        for cost, i, j in sorted(g):
            pa, pb = find(i), find(j)
            if pa == pb:
                continue
            p[pa] = pb
            res += cost
            n -= 1
            if n == 1:
                break
