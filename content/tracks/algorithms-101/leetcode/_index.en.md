## Prepare

Use these VSCode extensions to debug/submit:

- [LeetCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode)
- [Debug LeetCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wangtao0101.debug-leetcode)

## Tips I learned

- Don't code before "design" and understand the solution algorithm
- First 20 problems. Spent 5 min for thinking. Next look for 2-3 different approaches. Understand. Decide. Write.
