[LeetCode problem 1931](https://leetcode.com/problems/painting-a-grid-with-three-different-colors/)

```python
class Solution:
    def colorTheGrid(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        def f1(x: int) -> bool:
            last = -1
            for _ in range(m):
                if x % 3 == last:
                    return False
                last = x % 3
                x //= 3
            return True

        def f2(x: int, y: int) -> bool:
            for _ in range(m):
                if x % 3 == y % 3:
                    return False
                x, y = x // 3, y // 3
            return True

        mod = 10**9 + 7
        mx = 3**m
        valid = {i for i in range(mx) if f1(i)}
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for x in valid:
            for y in valid:
                if f2(x, y):
                    d[x].append(y)
        f = [int(i in valid) for i in range(mx)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            g = [0] * mx
            for i in valid:
                for j in d[i]:
                    g[i] = (g[i] + f[j]) % mod
            f = g
        return sum(f) % mod
