## A. Sum

https://codeforces.com/contest/1742/problem/A

**Solution:**

```python
def inp_int_list(): return list(map(int, inp().split()))

def solve():
    arr = inp_int_list()
    arr.sort()
    if arr[0] + arr[1] == arr[2]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


def run():
    for _ in range(inp_int()):
        solve()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    CODE_DEBUG = 0
    if os.environ.get("CODE_DEBUG") or CODE_DEBUG:
        sys.stdin = open("./input.txt", "r")
        start_time = time.time()
        run()
        print("\n--- %s seconds ---\n" % (time.time() - start_time))
    else:
        run()
```


## B. Increasing

https://codeforces.com/contest/1742/problem/B


**Solution:**

```python
def solve():
    n = inp_int()
    arr = inp_int_list()
    unique = set(arr)
    if n == len(unique):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

**Explanation from Codeforces:**

If there are two elements with the same value, then the answer is `NO`, because neither of these values is less than the other.

Otherwise, the answer is `YES`, since we can just sort the array.

## C. Stripes

https://codeforces.com/contest/1742/problem/C


Assuming that `row` or `col` exists with letter, check all rows for *horizontal red rows*. If not then answer is `B`.

**Solution:**

```python
def solve():
    inp()
    grid = [inp() for _ in range(8)]
    for row in grid:
        if all(c == 'R' for c in row):
            print('R')
            return
    print('B')
    return
```

**Explanation from Codeforces:**

Note that if a stripe is painted last, then the entire stripe appears in the final picture (because no other stripe is covering it).

Since rows are only painted red and columns are only painted blue, we can just check if any row contains 8 Rs. If there is such a row, then red was painted last; otherwise, blue was painted last.
