<mark>[Asterisk-Minor Template (implementation, strings, 1000)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1796/problem/B)</mark>

1. If the **first** characters of both strings are the same, create a template that consists of the common character followed by an asterisk (e.g., `a*`).
2. If the **last** characters of both strings are the same, create a template that consists of an asterisk followed by the common character (e.g., `*b`).
3. If neither the first nor the last characters are the same, iterate through string `a` and check for any 2-character substring that also appears in string `b`. 
   1. If a match is found, create a template that consists of an asterisk, the 2-character substring, and another asterisk (e.g., `ab`).
4. If no template is found, print `NO`.

**Solution:**

```python
def solve():
    a = input()
    b = input()

    if a[0] == b[0]:
        print('YES')
        print(f'{a[0]}*')
    elif a[-1] == b[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(f'*{a[-1]}')
    else:
        for i in range(len(a)-1):
            if a[i:i+2] in b:
                print('YES')
                print(f'*{a[i:i+2]}*')
                return
        print('NO')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    solve()
```
