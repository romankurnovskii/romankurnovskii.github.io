<mark>[1799A - Recent Actions (data structures, greedy, implementation, math, 800)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1799/problem/A)</mark>

**Explanation:**

On Codeforces, the "Recent Actions" field shows the last `n` posts with recent actions. Initially, there are posts numbered `1` to `n` in the field, in order from top to bottom. There are also infinitely many posts not in the field, numbered with integers `n+1`, `n+2`, and so on.

When a recent action happens in post `p`:

- If it is in the "Recent Actions" field, it moves from its position to the top position.
- Otherwise, it is added to the top position, and the post in the bottom position is removed from the "Recent Actions" field.

You know that the next `m` recent actions (**Note, that recent actions only happen with posts with numbers ≥+1.**) will happen in the posts `p1, p2, ..., pm (n+1 ≤ pi ≤ n+m)` at moments of time `1, 2, ..., m`. Note that recent actions only happen with posts with numbers `≥ n+1`.

For each post i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), find the first time it will be removed from the "Recent Actions" field or say that it won't be removed.

**Example:**

Analyze example #7:

Input:

```
3 5
4 5 5 5 4
```

Consider there is only one test case with `n = 3` and `m = 5`. 

The recent actions are `p1 = 4`, `p2 = 5`, `p3 = 5`, `p4 = 5`, `p5 = 4`.

Initial state of the "Recent Actions" field: `[1, 2, 3]`.

1. At moment 1 (post 4):

   - Post 4 is not in the "Recent Actions" field. So, it is added to the top position, and the post at the bottom (post 3) is removed.
   - "Recent Actions" field becomes `[4, 1, 2]`.

2. At moment 2 (post 5):

   - Post 5 is not in the "Recent Actions" field. So, it is added to the top position, and the post at the bottom (post 2) is removed.
   - "Recent Actions" field becomes `[5, 4, 1]`.

3. At moment 3 (post 5):

   - Post 5 is already in the "Recent Actions" field. So, it moves to the top position.
   - "Recent Actions" field remains `[5, 4, 1]`.

4. At moment 4 (post 5):

   - Post 5 is already in the "Recent Actions" field. So, it moves to the top position.
   - "Recent Actions" field remains `[5, 4, 1]`.

5. At moment 5 (post 4):

   - Post 4 is already in the "Recent Actions" field. So, it moves to the top position.
   - "Recent Actions" field becomes `[4, 5, 1]`.


In this example, post `1` is never removed, post `2` is removed at moment **2**, and post `3` is removed at moment **1**.
m
As initial "Recent Actions" was `[1,2,3]`, the output for this input would be: `-1 2 1`

**Solution Logic:**

1. Initialize an array `tracked_data` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`.
   1. This array will be a result array. Set `-1` for all elements setting initially that no one element will be removed.
2. Initialize an array `recent_posts` to keep track on current "recent actions".
3. Iterate through `posts` that got from output.
   1. If `post` is already in `recent_posts`, it means no need to remove anything, move this "found" post to index `0` and shift other elements in `recent_posts`.
   2. If `post` is **not in** `recent_posts`, then 
      1. add it to index `0` of `recent_posts` and remove "last" post from `recent_posts`.
      2. if "last" post in `recent_posts` is `<=n` that means that it is to be removed. In `tracked_data` set current `moment` when it is removed.
4. Print `tracked_data`


**Solution:**

This solution works but **slow**:

```python
def solve():
    n, m = list(map(int, inp().split()))
    posts = list(map(int, inp().split()))
    tracked_data = [-1] * n

    recent_posts = list(range(1, n+1))

    for moment, post in enumerate(posts, 1):
        if post in recent_posts:
            idx = recent_posts.index(post)
            recent_posts = [post] + recent_posts[0:idx] + recent_posts[idx+1:]
        else:
            
            last = recent_posts[-1] # set at what moment removed
            if last <= n:
                tracked_data[last-1] = moment
            if post <= n:
                tracked_data[post-1] = -1
            recent_posts = [post] + recent_posts[0:-1]

    print(*tracked_data)

for _ in range(int(inp())):
    solve()
```

As a result no need to keep `recent_posts` always uptodate. We need to follow for the posts that are in `range<=n`.

All what we need is:
1. to keep `last` post index to know what `post` is going to be removed. No need to rearrange array for this.
2. keep data on "already used" posts.

Updated code:

```python
def solve():
    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))
    posts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    tracked_data = [-1] * n

    last = n-1
    used_posts = set()
    for moment, post in enumerate(posts, 1):
        if post not in used_posts:
            if last >= 0:
                tracked_data[last] = moment
                last -= 1
                used_posts.add(post)
    print(*tracked_data)


for _ in range(int(input())):
    solve()
```
