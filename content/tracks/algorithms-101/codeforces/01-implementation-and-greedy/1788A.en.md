<mark>[1788A - One and Two (brute force, implementation, math, 800)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1788/problem/A)</mark>

This problem is about finding a specific index `𝑘` in a given sequence of integers $𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑛$, where each element is either `1` or `2`. The goal is to determine whether there exists an integer `𝑘` such that the product of all elements from $𝑎_1$ to $𝑎_𝑘$ is equal to the product of all elements from $𝑎_𝑘+1$ to $𝑎_𝑛$.

Because of product of `1` doesn't change the result we can focus on `2`. Product in left side and in the right side can be equal only if count of `2` is even or equal `0`.

1. We can count number of `2`.
2. The result will be the index of the *middle* `2` in array.

## Solution

```python
def solve(ar):
    twos = ar.count(2)
    if twos % 2 != 0:
        return -1

    passed_twos = 0
    need_twos = twos // 2
    for i, x in enumerate(ar):
        if x == 2:
            passed_twos += 1
        if passed_twos == need_twos:
            return i+1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(solve(ar))
```
