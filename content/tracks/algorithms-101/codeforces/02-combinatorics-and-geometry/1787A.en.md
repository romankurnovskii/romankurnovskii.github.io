<mark>[1787A - Exponential Equation (constructive algorithms, math, 800)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1787/problem/A)</mark>

## Logic

The equation is a mix of multiplication and exponential operations. Given the nature of exponential operations, $ùë•^ùë¶$ and $ùë¶^ùë•$ can grow very large very quickly as `x` and `y` increase.

We can try to simplify the equation.

If we can somehow set one of the variables `x` or `y` to 1, the equation simplifies. 

This is because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 1 is the number itself, and any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

So, if we set `x = 1`, the equation simplifies to `1^y * y + y^1 * 1 = n`, which further simplifies to `y + y = n`, or `2y = n`. This is a simple linear equation, and we can see that for any even `n` greater than 2, it has a solution in integers. The solution is `x = 1` and `y = n/2`.

- For `n = 2`, we can set both `x` and `y` to `1`, and the equation holds. It can be a base case.
- For **odd** `n` greater than 2, and for `n = 1`, there's no solution in integers.


## Solution

```python
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print(1, 1)
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        print(1, n//2)
    else:
        print(-1)


for _ in range(int(input())):
    solve()
```
