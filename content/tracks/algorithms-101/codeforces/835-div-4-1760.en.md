### A. Medium Number

https://codeforces.com/contest/1760/problem/A

**Solution:**

```python
def solve():
    ar = inpl()
    ar.sort()
    return ar[1]


def run():
    for _ in range(inpi()):
        print(solve())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    CODE_DEBUG = 0
    if os.environ.get("CODE_DEBUG") or CODE_DEBUG:
        sys.stdin = open("./input.txt", "r")
        start_time = time.time()
        run()
        print("\n--- %s seconds ---\n" % (time.time() - start_time))
    else:
        run()
```


### B. Atilla's Favorite Problem

https://codeforces.com/contest/1760/problem/B


Minimum **size** of alphabet is the **ordinal number** of a letter in the *string*.

1. Go through each letter and find the max letter's code with built-in function `[ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord)`

**Solution:**

```python
def solve():
    n = inp()
    s = inp()

    last_i = 0
    for i in s:
        last_i = max(last_i, ord(i) - 97 + 1) # for letter 'a' unicode code is 97

    return last_i
```

**Explanation from Codeforces:**

To solve the problem we need to find the character with the highest alphabetical order in our string, since Atilla will need at least that alphabet size and won't need more. To do this iterate through the string and find the character with the highest alphabetical order. Output the maximum alphabetical order found. The solution can be done in $𝑂(𝑛)$.

### C. Advantage

https://codeforces.com/contest/1760/problem/C

1. Need to know the **strongest** participant.
2. Compare *current* with *strongest*.
3. If current participant is the *strongest*, then compare it with the *second strongest*.


**Solution:**

1. Find two strongest.
2. Loop and calculate diff.

```python
def solve():
    n = inp()
    ar = inpl()

    result = ar[:]

    ar.sort()
    strongest, strongest2 = ar[-1], ar[-1]
    if len(ar) > 1:
        strongest2 = ar[-2]
    
    for i, x in enumerate(result):
        if x == strongest:
            result[i] = x - strongest2
        else:
            result[i] = x - strongest

    return list_to_string_list(result)
```

**Explanation from Codeforces:**

Make a copy of the array `𝑠`: call it `𝑡`. Sort `𝑡` in non-decreasing order, so that `𝑡1` is the maximum strength and $𝑡_2$ — the second maximum strength.

Then for everyone but the best person, they should compare with the best person who has strength $𝑡_1$. So for all $𝑖$ such that $𝑠_𝑖 ≠ 𝑡_1$, we should output $𝑠_𝑖−𝑡_1$. Otherwise, output $𝑠_𝑖−𝑡_2$ — the second highest strength, which is the next best person.
