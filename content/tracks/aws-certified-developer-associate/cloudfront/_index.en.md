## About

Securely deliver data, videos, applicÂ­ations, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, and high transfer speeds

CloudFront is a distributed content delivery network (CDN) that enables easy delivery of web content to end users from a pool of web servers around the globe

**CloudFront is a global service:**

- Ingress to upload objects.
- Egress to distribute content.

### Terminology

- **Edge Location:** The location where content is cached to be accessed by users. These are READ/WRITE.
- **CDN:** A collection of Edge Locations that can distribute content around the world.
- **Origin:** The origin of all files the CDN will distribute. E.g.
  - an S3 bucket hosting some images, or hosting a static website
  - an EC2 instance running a website with dynamic content
  - an ELB pointing to several EC2 instances
  - a DNS endpoint using Route53
  - any origin server, even non-AWS
- **Distribution**: The name of the CDN.
  - **Web Distribution**: Used for delivering content over HTTP/HTTPS. Can be either an S3 bucket or a web server (EC2/non-AWS). Cannot serve multimedia content.
  - **RTMP Distribution**: Uses RTMP for media streaming and flash multimedia content. Probably what Netflix uses.

## Price

**Which API command can a developer use to ensure cache storage consistency with minimal duplication?**

- A) CreateReusableDelegationSet with Route 53
- B) CreateStackSet with CloudFormation
- C) CreateGlobalReplicationGroup with ElastiCache
- D) CreateCachePolicy with CloudFront

### Q2

**A developer is designing a web application that allows the users to post comments and receive in a real-time feedback.**

**Which architectures meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)**

1. Create an AWS AppSync schema and corresponding APIs. Use an [Amazon DynamoDB](../dynamodb) table as the data store.
2. Create a WebSocket API in Amazon API Gateway. Use an [AWS Lambda](../lambda) function as the backend and an [Amazon DynamoDB](../dynamodb) table as the data store
3. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application backed by an Amazon RDS database. Configure the application to allow long-lived TCP/IP sockets.
4. Create a GraphQL endpoint in Amazon API Gateway. Use an [Amazon DynamoDB](../dynamodb) table as the data store.
5. Enable WebSocket on Amazon CloudFront. Use an [AWS Lambda](../lambda) function as the origin and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as the data store

[AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) simplifies application development by letting users create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources. AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to get the exact data they need.

AWS AppSync allows users to build scalable applications, including those requiring [real-time updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/real-time-data.html), on a range of data sources, including Amazon DynamoDB. In [Amazon API Gateway](../api-gateway), users can [create a WebSocket API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html) as a stateful frontend for an AWS service (such as [AWS Lambda](../lambda) or DynamoDB) or for an HTTP endpoint.

The WebSocket API invokes the backend based on the content of the messages it receives from client applications. Unlike a REST API, which receives and responds to requests, a WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client applications and the backend.
