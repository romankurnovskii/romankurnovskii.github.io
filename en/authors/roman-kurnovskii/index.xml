Problem Statement In this problem, you&amp;rsquo;re given an array of integers nums and an integer target. Your task is to find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. The input array is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and you can&amp;rsquo;t use the same element twice. The indices can be returned in any order.
Naive Solution A naive solution would involve using two nested loops to iterate through each pair of elements in the array and check if their sum is equal to the target.</description></item><item><title>1.

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.</description></item><item><title>38.

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
countAndSay(1) = &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; countAndSay(n) is the way you would &amp;ldquo;say&amp;rdquo; the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string. To determine how you &amp;ldquo;say&amp;rdquo; a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.</description></item><item><title>46.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description></item><item><title>Deposit Interactive Brokers from Israel Discount bank</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/interactivebrokers-deposit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/interactivebrokers-deposit/</guid><description>Web Create IB notification Login to https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/portal/#/ Click Deposit Click Use a new deposit method if no one exist Bank Wire -&amp;gt; Get instructions Account Number: Bank account number

Content on is in different languages.
The goal is to impelemnt search for all pages and separate search results for each and every language.
How it works Hugo generates the search index. In this case it means that we get json file with every static page on the site.
To make search works we need to create index. lunr.js takes care of it.

This means that we get the html code as it is written in markdown.
In order to understand which images we can enhance, we add a separate tag/key/id to those images
Tools To implement the functionality, we need to:
Write/connect a script/handler that will perform the zoomin effect on the images we need Add the necessary metadata to the images, so the script can find them zoomin script To add the ability to zoom on click, we will use the medium-zoom package.</description></item><item><title>Automating Code Reviews with Amazon CodeGuru</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/codeguru/automating-code-reviews-amazon-codeguru/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/codeguru/automating-code-reviews-amazon-codeguru/</guid><description>Lab Automating Code Reviews with Amazon CodeGuru Associating Amazon CodeGuru with a CodeCommit Repository 1.

os.rename Rename files with os
You can use
os.rename(old_name, new_name) For example we can combine it with os.path.splitext() to get the base name and file extension, and then combine it to a new name:
import os for file in os.listdir(): name, ext = os.path.splitext(file) new_name = f&amp;#34;{name}_new{ext}&amp;#34; os.rename(file, new_name) pathlib Rename files with pathlib
