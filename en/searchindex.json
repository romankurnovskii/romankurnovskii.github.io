Your task is to find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. The input array is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and you can’t use the same element twice. The indices can be returned in any order.\nNaive Solution A naive solution would involve using two nested loops to iterate through each pair of elements in the array and check if their sum is equal to the target. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. However, there is a more efficient solution that uses a hash table and has a time complexity of O(n).\nHints \u0026 Tips A hash table (or dictionary in Python) is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values in O(1) time on average. It uses key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.\nApproach To solve this problem efficiently, we’ll use a hash table to store the indices of the numbers we’ve seen so far. For each number, we’ll check if the difference between the target and the current number is already in the hash table. If it is, we’ve found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we’ll return their indices.\nSteps Initialize an empty hash table to store the indices of the numbers we’ve seen so far.

If it is, return the indices of the current number and the number that corresponds to the difference. If the difference is not in the hash table, add the current number and its index to the hash table.

This would involve nested loops, with the outer loop iterating through the array and the inner loops flipping zeros and calculating sequences of 1’s. This approach can be extremely slow, especially for larger arrays.\nHints \u0026 Tips The task can be tackled more efficiently with a sliding window approach. This technique can be applied when we want to examine a continuous chunk of elements in an array, such as a substring or subarray.\nApproach: Sliding Window We expand our window to the right each time and record the zeros we find. If the number of zeros exceeds k, we shrink the window from the left until we’re back to at most k zeros. We can track the longest window we’ve found during this process, which corresponds to the maximum number of consecutive 1’s. If the number of zeros exceeds k, we shrink the window from the left until we’re back to at most k zeros.\nWe can track the longest window we’ve found during this process, which corresponds to the maximum number of consecutive 1’s.\nSteps Initialize two pointers, left and right, to represent the window’s boundaries. Also, initialize a counter zero_count to track zeros in the current window. Expand the right boundary of the window by moving the right pointer. If the current number is 0, increment the zero_count.

Your task is to determine the longest string chain you can form given this list. A word A can be a predecessor of word B if by adding exactly one letter to A (at any position), B is formed. The objective is to find the longest sequence where each word is a predecessor of the next.\nNaive Solution The straightforward brute-force way would be to try all possible combinations of word chains. Starting with each word, try to find its successor in the list and continue this until no more successors can be found. Remember the longest chain you can form. This solution, however, will be inefficient, especially with larger lists.\nHints \u0026 Tips A valuable hint for this problem is to consider sorting the words based on their lengths. This ensures that words of length n will only ever be predecessors to words of length n + 1.\nApproach The efficient way to solve this problem is using Dynamic Programming. The core idea is to maintain a hashmap where the key is a word and the value is the maximum chain length with that word as the end. This hashmap will assist in building solutions for longer words based on the solutions of shorter ones.\nSteps Sort the Words: First, sort the words by their lengths. This guarantees when processing a word, all potential predecessors have already been handled. Hashmap for Chain Length: As each word is processed, inspect all its possible predecessors (by removing one character from the word). Use the hashmap to fetch the chain length of the predecessor and add one to it. Determine Maximum Chain Length: As each word is processed, update the maximum chain length.

The term “GCD” might be familiar from mathematics, as the largest number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. Here, we extend the idea to strings: a string x is a GCD of strings str1 and str2 if x can be repeatedly appended to itself to obtain str1 and str2.\nNaive Solution A naive approach would be to find all possible divisors of str1 and str2, and then find the largest common divisor. This would involve generating all substrings of str1 and str2 which is time-consuming and unnecessary.\nSolution Observing the problem, we see a similarity with the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers. In the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of two numbers a and b (a \u003e b) is the same as the GCD of b and a mod b.\nWe can extend this logic to strings. If a string x is a GCD of str1 and str2, then str1 and str2 can both be written in the form x + x + ... + x. Therefore, str1 - str2 (which is similar to a mod b) should also be expressible in the form x + x + ... + x.\nThis observation allows us to use a similar approach to the Euclidean algorithm to solve this problem.\nWhy finding Greatest common divisor?\nIn case smallest string consist multiple same parts.\nExample: str1 = “ABABAB”, str2 = “ABAB”.\nlen(str1) = 6, len(str2) = 4. We can’t use whole str2 but common minimum length -\u003e 2.\nSteps Here are the high-level steps of the algorithm:\nIf str1 + str2 is not equal to str2 + str1, return an empty string. Otherwise, find the GCD of the lengths of str1 and str2. Return the prefix substring of str1 with length equal to the GCD. Solution Here is a Python solution that implements the above algorithm:\nclass Solution: def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -\u003e str: def gcd(a, b): while b != 0: a, b = b, a % b return a if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1: return '' max_substr_len = gcd(len(str1), len(str2)) return str1[:max_substr_len] In the gcdOfStrings method, we first check if str1 + str2 is equal to str2 + str1. If they are not equal, no common divisor string exists, so we return an empty string. If they are equal, we find the GCD of the lengths of str1 and str2 and return the prefix substring of str1 with length equal to the GCD.\nThe gcd method is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.\n","description":"Finding the greatest common divisor of two strings","title":"1071.

These lines, along with the x-axis, form a series of containers. Your goal is to find the two lines that form the container with the greatest area.\nNaive Solution The naive solution is to consider all pairs of lines and calculate the area of water each pair can contain. You would keep track of the maximum area encountered. This solution would take O(n^2) time, which is not efficient.\nHints \u0026 Tips The height of the water in any container is limited by the shorter of the two lines forming the container. Moreover, farther the lines, more will be the width of the container and thus, more will be the water it can contain.\nApproach We can achieve a more efficient solution by using the two-pointer technique.\nStart with two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array. The initial container therefore includes the entire array, and has a certain amount of water. Then, moving the pointers inward, you measure the container at each step, always choosing the pointer at the shorter line to move. This is based on the rationale that moving the pointer at the taller line would not affect the container’s height but reduce its width.\nSteps Initialize left and right pointers at the start and end of the array. Calculate the initial area and set it as the maximum area. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer: If the height at the left pointer is less than or equal to the height at the right pointer, increment the left pointer. Otherwise, decrement the right pointer. Calculate the area each time the pointers are moved, and update the maximum area if the current area is greater. Why it is important to find the minimum height of pointer?:\nThe area of the container is determined by the shorter line and the distance between the two lines. Therefore, if we move the pointer at the taller line inward, we might get a taller height but the width between the two lines, and therefore the possible area, is guaranteed to decrease.\nSo the overall area is most likely going to decrease or stay the same. Because of this, we decide to move the pointer at the shorter line, in the hopes that we will find a taller line that will increase the area.\nFor example, consider an array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. When the left pointer is at the first position (height 1) and the right pointer is at the second last position (height 3), if we move the right pointer, we may come across a taller line (7) but since the left line (height 1) is still shorter, the possible area is still going to be less due to reduced width.\nHowever, if we move the left pointer, we may come across a taller line (8) and this could increase the possible area.\nSo, the condition if height[left] \u003c= height[right] is there to always move the pointer at the shorter line.\nSolution def maxArea(height): left = 0 right = len(height) - 1 max_area = 0 while left \u003c right: min_height = min(height[left], height[right]) area = min_height * (right - left) max_area = max(max_area, area) if height[left] \u003c= height[right]: left += 1 else: right -= 1 return max_area ","description":"Finding the container that can hold the most water based on given heights.","title":"11.

In the backtrack function, if the current position is at the end of the string, add the current partition to the result list, which stores all valid palindrome partitions found so far. Iterate through the string from the current position to the end. For each character, extract the substring from the current position to the current character and check if this substring is a palindrome using the is_palindrome function. If the substring is a palindrome, add it to the current partition and call the backtrack function recursively with the next position. After the backtrack function call, remove the last substring from the current partition. This is the backtracking step, which allows the function to explore other possible palindrome substrings starting from the current position. Call the backtrack function with the initial values (current_position = 0 and current_partition = []) and return the result list. The backtrack function works by iterating through the string from the current position to the end, checking if the substring from the current position to the current character is a palindrome.\nIf it finds a palindrome, it adds this substring to the current_partition and calls itself recursively with the next position.\nThis process continues until we reach the end of the string, at which point we have found a valid partition, and we add the current_partition to the result list.\nAfter the recursive call, the function backtracks by removing the last substring from the current_partition. This step allows the function to explore other possible palindrome substrings starting from the current position.\nIn summary, the backtrack function is a recursive helper function that helps us explore all possible palindrome partitions by iterating through the string, checking for palindromes, and calling itself recursively with updated input arguments.\nclass Solution: def partition(self, s): def is_palindrome(substr): return substr == substr[::-1] result = [] def backtrack(start, current_partition): if start == len(s): result.append(current_partition[:]) return for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1): substr = s[start:end] if is_palindrome(substr): current_partition.append(substr) backtrack(end, current_partition) current_partition.pop() backtrack(0, []) return result Your browser does not support the video tag.

A ZigZag path is defined by a sequence starting at any node and switching between left and right directions at each subsequent step.\nNaive Solution A simplistic approach would be to kick off from every node and emulate the ZigZag movement until it’s no longer feasible, all the while updating the longest path encountered. This method can be rather inefficient as it leads to a lot of recalculations.\nHints \u0026 Tips A Depth First Search (DFS) can be an efficient way to tackle this problem. The current path length and direction can be passed as arguments to the DFS function, negating the need for recalculations.\nApproach Imagine walking through the tree. Every time you take a step, you must decide whether to go left or right. But, the twist here is that you have to alternate your direction at every step. The challenge? Find the longest path you can take without breaking this rule.\nTo systematically explore all possible paths, we use Depth First Search (DFS), a tree traversal strategy. Instead of starting from scratch at every node, we remember our previous direction (left or right) and continue in the opposite direction, effectively extending our ZigZag path. If a move in the current direction isn’t possible, that path ends there, but the search continues. By doing so, we can explore all potential ZigZag paths efficiently.\nSteps Initialize DFS from the root, considering both left and right as potential starting directions. At each node, based on your previous direction, try extending the ZigZag by moving in the opposite direction, thus increasing the length. If you hit a dead end (no further movement possible in the current direction), check if this path length is your longest so far. Regardless of whether the current path continues, keep exploring the tree in both directions.

After executing a certain algorithm on arr, we get a value known as search_cost. Our goal is to ensure search_cost is equal to k. The main challenge is determining how many ways we can construct such an array arr.\nNaive Solution A naive approach might involve generating all possible array combinations, then determining which ones fulfill our criteria. This method, however, would be inefficient due to its exponential time complexity.

Keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far can help narrow down the possible outcomes. Approach / Idea To tackle this problem efficiently, we use dynamic programming. The main idea is to maintain a three-dimensional dp array, which keeps track of:\nCurrent length of the array we’re constructing (i). The maximum value used so far (max_so_far). Remaining comparisons (remain). With this DP table, we can progressively compute how many ways we can construct an array of length i while meeting our conditions.\nSteps / High-Level Algorithm Initialize the DP Array: Create a three-dimensional dp array filled with zeros.\nBase Case: When the array length equals n, the possible values for max_so_far are already decided, hence set dp[n][max_so_far][0] to 1.\nFill the DP Table:\nIterate backwards, starting from the end towards the beginning. For each i, determine the number of ways we can construct an array of that length based on max_so_far and remain.

This can be done using nested loops. The outer loop runs through each character in the string while the inner loop counts the vowels for each substring of length k. The maximum count is then returned.\nHowever, this naive solution would be computationally expensive, with a time complexity of $O(n*k)$ where n is the length of the string s.\nHints \u0026 Tips The problem can be efficiently solved using a technique called the sliding window approach.\nApproach: Sliding Window The idea is to use a window of size k and slide it across the string s.

You are expected to return a string with the words in reversed order and separated by a single space. It is important to note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words, but the returned string should not contain any extra spaces.\nNaive Solution A naive solution could be to split the input string into individual words and then reverse the order of these words. However, this would require extra space to store the words and does not take care of multiple, leading, or trailing spaces.\nHints \u0026 Tips Python’s built-in string methods split and join can be very helpful in this problem. The split method can be used to split the string into individual words, and it also takes care of multiple spaces. The join method can be used to concatenate the words in reverse order.\nApproach An efficient approach would be to:\nSplit the string into individual words using the split method.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. The interesting part of this problem is that the array can contain both positive and negative numbers, so the maximum product can be obtained by a subarray ending at any index of the array.\nNaive Solution A naive approach to this problem would be to calculate the product of all possible subarrays and return the maximum one. However, this would have a time complexity of O(n²), as there are n*(n+1)/2 subarrays of an array, where n is the length of the array.\nThis would be inefficient and time-consuming for large inputs.\nDynamic Programming We can solve this problem efficiently using Dynamic Programming.\nThe idea is to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position (as the array can contain negative numbers, and a negative number can become maximum when multiplied by another negative number).\nWe initialize two variables, max_prod and min_prod, to nums[0]. Then for each number in the array (from the second number to the end), we calculate max_prod and min_prod using the formulas:\nmax_prod = max(nums[i], max_prod * nums[i], min_prod * nums[i]) min_prod = min(nums[i], max_prod * nums[i], min_prod * nums[i]) We also keep track of res, which stores the maximum product of a subarray as a result.\nIf max_prod is greater than res, we update res.\nFinally, res will hold the maximum product of a subarray.\nSteps Initialize max_prod, min_prod, and res to nums[0].

Move each pointer to the next node in its list. If a pointer reaches the end of its list, move it to the start of the other list. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the two pointers meet, or until both pointers have switched lists and reached the end (meaning there is no intersection). The key insight is that by switching lists when a pointer reaches the end, each pointer traverses the same total number of nodes. This means they must meet at the intersection if one exists.\nclass Solution: def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode): pointerA, pointerB = headA, headB # Continue until the pointers meet while pointerA != pointerB: # Move each pointer to the next node, # or to the start of the other list if it reached the end pointerA = pointerA.next if pointerA else headB pointerB = pointerB.next if pointerB else headA # Return the intersecting node, or None if there is no intersection return pointerA It may seem like the loop could run forever because it continues until the two pointers meet and each pointer is always moved forward (to the next node or to the start of the other list).\nIf the two linked lists intersect, then from the point of intersection, they share the same nodes until the end. The two pointers will meet at the intersection point because when each pointer has traversed its own list once and then the other list, they have both traversed exactly the same number of nodes in total (the length of list A plus the length of list B). So, they must meet at the intersection point if one exists.\nIf the linked lists do not intersect, the pointers will both reach the end of the other list after traversing both lists. They’ll be both set to None, and the loop condition pointerA != pointerB will fail, terminating the loop.\nSo, regardless of whether the linked lists intersect, the loop will eventually terminate.

If it’s not feasible, the answer should be -1.\nNaive Solution The naive approach would be to explore every possible combination of removing elements from the start or the end, recursively. While this approach can find the solution, it’s extremely inefficient and would result in a time complexity beyond O(2^n).\nApproach The problem can be turned around: Instead of trying to determine which numbers to remove from the ends, think of it as finding the longest subarray inside nums such that the sum of its elements is equal to the total sum of nums minus x. Let’s call this approach in mathematics “from the reverse”.\nWhy does this work? Well, if we find the maximum-length subarray with a sum equal to total - x, then the numbers we need to remove from the array will be the numbers outside this subarray!\nThis transformed problem can be tackled using a two-pointer or sliding window approach.\nSteps Calculate the total sum of nums.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.\nThis problem is about converting a fraction to its decimal representation in string format. The tricky part is dealing with repeating decimals. If a decimal repeats, we should enclose the repeating part in parentheses.\nFor example, if we have a fraction 1/3, the decimal representation would be 0.3333…. In this problem, we need to represent it as “0.(3)”.\nNaive Solution A naive solution could involve simple division - you divide the numerator by the denominator and convert it to a string. However, this wouldn’t account for recurring decimals, and it would only be correct for fractions that result in a finite decimal.\nApproach A better approach to solve this problem involves using the long division method and a hash map to keep track of remainders. If the same remainder appears again, it means we have found a repeating sequence.\nIn long division, we divide the numerator by the denominator, find the remainder, and then add a zero to the remainder and repeat the process.\nWhile doing this, if we encounter the same remainder that we have seen before, it means the sequence will start to repeat from here.\nSteps First, handle the simple case where numerator is divisible by denominator. If the division isn’t exact, proceed with the long division method. Keep dividing the numerator by the denominator and track the remainder.

The remainder and the index at which it appears are stored in a dictionary. Whenever a remainder repeats, it means we have found a repeating sequence and the division process is stopped. The repeating part is then enclosed in parentheses.\nAlso, note the line if (numerator \u003c 0) ^ (denominator \u003c 0):. This is checking if the result should be negative. If either, but not both, of the numerator and denominator are negative, the result should also be negative. Here ^ is the bitwise XOR operator in Python, which returns True if exactly one of the conditions is True.\nAfter doing all this, if the numerator was negative, we add a negative sign to the front of our result.

In each operation, we find the largest element in the array, find the next largest element that is strictly smaller than the largest, and reduce the largest element to this next largest value. The task is to return the number of such operations needed to make all array elements equal.\nNaive Solution One might consider a brute-force approach: repeatedly scanning the array to find the largest element and its next largest, then performing the reduction. However, this approach would have a high time complexity, especially with larger arrays.\nHints \u0026 Tips Think about sorting the array to make it easier to find the largest and next largest elements. Consider how the number of reduction operations relates to the positions of the elements in the sorted array. Approach / Idea Imagine you have a stack of books of different thicknesses. Your task is to make all books have the same thickness by repeatedly choosing the thickest book and trimming it down to the next thickest one. The key to doing this efficiently is to first arrange the books in order of thickness, from thickest to thinnest. Once sorted, it’s straightforward to find the thickest book and the next thickest one.\nApplying this analogy to our problem, sorting the nums array in descending order (non-ascending) is akin to arranging the books. The largest number in the array is like the thickest book, and the next largest is like the next thickest book in the stack. By sorting the array, we can easily keep track of when we encounter a new “largest” element (or a new “thickest book”) as we iterate through the array.\nExample Consider the array [5, 1, 3]. After sorting, it becomes [5, 3, 1]. The first largest value is 5, and the next largest is 3. To make 5 equal to 3, we perform one operation. We then make 3 equal to 1 in the next step. Each step or operation can be counted by the position of these numbers in the sorted array.\nThus, we count the number of operations required to reduce each element to the next largest value, which directly correlates to its index in the sorted array.\nThe key to efficiently solving this problem lies in sorting the array. Once sorted, we can easily track the largest element and its next largest. The number of operations required to reduce an element to the next largest is directly related to its position in the sorted array.\nAlgorithm Sort the Array:\nSort nums in non-ascending order. Count Reduction Operations:\nIterate through the sorted array. Whenever the current element is different from the previous one (indicating a new largest element), increase the operation count by its index. Return the Count:\nThe total count is the number of operations needed.

In each rotation, we shift every element of the array to the right by one and move the last element to the start of the array. This solution has a time complexity of O(n*k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of rotations. This is not an optimal solution, especially when we have a large k or a large array.\nApproach An efficient solution can be found by using array reversal. Here’s the plan:\nReverse the entire array.

Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).\nNaive Solution A naive solution to this problem could involve converting the number to a binary string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer. However, this would not be the most efficient solution, especially for large numbers.\nApproach Using bitwise operation.\nA better approach is to manipulate the bits of the number directly. This can be done by initializing an empty result and then repeatedly shifting the result to the left to make room for the next bit, and adding the last bit of the input number.\nSteps Initialize the result to 0. Repeat the following steps 32 times, once for each bit in the input number: Shift the result one bit to the left to make room for the next bit. This can be done with the \u003c\u003c operator. Add the last bit of the input number to the result. This can be done with the \u0026 operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation. Shift the input number one bit to the right to prepare for the next iteration. This can be done with the \u003e\u003e operator.

We’re going to build this result bit by bit from the binary representation of n.\nThe key point of this operation is this line of code: result = (result \u003c\u003c 1) + (n \u0026 1). This line does three things:\n(result \u003c\u003c 1): This operation is a left shift operation. It shifts all the bits in result one place to the left. In binary, this is equivalent to multiplying by 2. So if result was 0101 (5 in decimal), after this operation result will be 1010 (10 in decimal). You can see we’ve made room for a new bit on the right. (n \u0026 1): This operation is a bitwise AND operation. The \u0026 operator compares each binary digit of two integers and returns a new integer, with a 1 wherever both numbers had a 1 and a 0 anywhere else. When n is ANDed with 1 (0000 0001), the result will be 1 only if the least significant bit of n is 1. This effectively gives us the last bit of n. (result \u003c\u003c 1) + (n \u0026 1): This line combines the above two steps. It shifts the bits of result one place to the left and adds the last bit of n to result. Let’s work through the first couple of iterations of the loop:\nOn the first iteration, result is 0000 0000. We shift result left (it remains 0000 0000), and add the last bit of n (which is 0). So result remains 0000 0000. We then shift n right to become 0011 0101 (n From 0110 1010 to 0011 0101). On the second iteration, result is 0000 0000. We shift result left (it remains 0000 0000), and add the last bit of n (which is 1). So result becomes 0000 0001. We then shift n right to become 0001 1010. If we repeat this process 8 times (for an 8-bit number), or 32 times (for a 32-bit number like in the problem), result will be the binary number formed by reversing the bits of n.\nOptimization If this function is called many times, way to optimize it is to cache the results for each byte (8 bits) instead of each bit. This would divide the computation time by 8.\n","description":"190. Reverse Bits","title":"190.

However, this solution is not optimal and is not taking advantage of the properties of binary numbers.\nAlgorithm The optimal solution for this problem involves using bitwise operation. Bitwise operations are a type of operation that works on the binary representation of numbers.\nSpecifically, we’ll use the bitwise AND operator (\u0026) and bitwise right shift operator (\u003e\u003e).\nTo count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number, we can AND the number with 1. If the result is 1, that means the least significant bit of the number is 1. We then right shift the number by 1 bit to check the next bit. We continue this process until the number becomes 0.\nHigh Level Solution Logic Initialize a counter variable to 0. While the number is not 0: AND the number with 1.

So, bits = 0. Start the loop. The number n is 11, which is not 0, so we proceed. We perform the operation n \u0026 1. In binary, 1011 \u0026 0001 equals 0001, which is 1 in decimal. This is because the bitwise AND operation returns 1 only if both bits being compared are 1. So, since our least significant bit is 1, our AND operation returns 1. We increment our counter bits by 1. Now bits = 1. We right shift our number by 1 bit using the operation n \u003e\u003e= 1. This operation moves all the bits of the number one position to the right. Our number 1011 becomes 101 in binary or 5 in decimal. Our updated number n is 5, which is not 0, so we repeat the process. Now, n \u0026 1 is 101 \u0026 001 equals 001, which is 1 in decimal. So, we increment our counter bits by 1. Now bits = 2. We right shift our number by 1 bit. Our number 101 becomes 10 in binary or 2 in decimal. Our updated number n is 2, which is not 0, so we repeat the process. Now, n \u0026 1 is 10 \u0026 01 equals 00, which is 0 in decimal. So, we do not increment our counter bits. We right shift our number by 1 bit. Our number 10 becomes 1 in binary. Our updated number n is 1, which is not 0, so we repeat the process. Now, n \u0026 1 is 1 \u0026 1 equals 1. So, we increment our counter bits by 1. Now bits = 3. We right shift our number by 1 bit. Our number 1 becomes 0 in binary. Our updated number n is 0, which stops the loop.

We have to determine whether this number is a “happy” number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:\nStarting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. Naive Solution A naive solution would be to follow the process as stated in the problem description and use a data structure such as a set to check for repetitions indicating a cycle. If during the process, the number becomes 1, we can conclude that the number is happy. However, if we encounter a number that was already visited, it means we are stuck in a cycle, and the number is not happy.\nWe calculate the sum of squares of the digits of n in each iteration, and check if this sum is 1 or a number we’ve seen before. If it’s 1, we return true. If it’s a number we’ve seen before, we return false, as this means we’re in an endless loop. Hints \u0026 Tips However, continuously checking if a number was already visited can be costly in terms of time complexity. A more efficient way to detect cycles is to use the Floyd Cycle detection algorithm (also known as the “Tortoise and the Hare” algorithm).\nThis algorithm allows us to detect a cycle in the sequence without having to store all previously seen numbers, making it more efficient in terms of space usage.\nApproach Floyd Cycle detection algorithm works by moving two pointers at different speeds - a slow pointer (tortoise) and a fast pointer (hare). If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer again.\nSteps Initialize two pointers slow and fast as n. Replace slow with the sum of the squares of its digits, and fast with the sum of squares of the next number in the sequence. If fast becomes 1, return True. - n is a happy number. If slow meets fast and the number is not 1, return False. - n is not a happy number as we have detected a cycle.

If fast equals 1 at the end of the loop, n is a happy number.\n","description":"Learn how to determine if a number is happy using Python.","title":"202.

Our task is to determine, for each person, how many flowers they will see in full bloom upon their arrival.\nNaive Solution A straightforward approach might involve iterating over each person’s arrival time. For each time, we could iterate over the flowers list to count how many flowers are in full bloom. This approach, however, would lead to a time complexity of O(n*m), with n being the number of people and m being the number of flowers.

Approach / Idea Instead of associating the start and end times of each flower’s blooming period, we can consider them separately.

Otherwise, it is not.\nThis solution takes O(n) time (where n is the number of nodes in the list), as we need to traverse the list once.\nHowever, it also takes O(n) space, as we store the value of each node in an array.\nApproach To solve the problem in O(n) time and O(1) space, we can use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.

The objective is to determine how many pairs of rows and columns in the grid are identical in terms of their content and order.\nTo elucidate, if row $r_i$ and column $c_j$ have the same integers in the exact same sequence, they are considered an “equal” pair. The challenge is to count all such pairs in the given matrix.\nNaive Solution A naive approach would be to compare each row with every column in the grid. This results in a $O(n^3)$ solution since for every row $O(n)$, you compare with each column $O(n)$, and for every comparison, you traverse the entire row or column $O(n)$. This method is inefficient for large matrices.\nApproach Instead of comparing every row with every column directly, we can convert each row and column into a tuple and utilize a dictionary to keep a count of occurrences of each unique row. While iterating through the columns, we can directly reference our dictionary to see if the tuple representation of the column matches with any row.\nWhy Tuples? Before we dive into the optimized approach, it’s essential to understand the role of tuples here. We transform rows and columns into tuples because:\nTuples are immutable: their content cannot be altered after they’re created. They can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists or sets.

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.\nNaive Solution A naive solution could be to create a new list, iterate over the array, add non-zero elements to the new list and count zero elements. Then extend the new list with the same amount of zeros as counted. But this solution requires creating a new list, which contradicts the in-place requirement of the problem.\nHints \u0026 Tips The key to solve this problem is to keep a pointer, let’s call it i, that would track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.\nApproach The provided solution employs a two-pass approach. In the first pass, it iterates over the list and whenever it encounters a non-zero element, it places it at the position i and increments i. After this pass, all non-zero elements are at the beginning of the list and i is set to the position of the first zero element.\nIn the second pass, it simply assigns zero to all positions from i to the end of the list.\nSteps Initialize i to 0. Iterate over nums. For each element, if it is not zero, assign it to nums[i] and increment i. After the iteration, i is at the position of the first zero in nums.

In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make num special. An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.\nNaive Solution A naive approach to solving this problem might involve recursively generating all possible substrings of the input string, checking each one for divisibility by 25. While this would yield the correct result, the time complexity would be exponential, making it unfeasible for larger inputs.\nHints \u0026 Tips The main insight is that to be divisible by 25, the last two digits of the number must be one of the following: 00, 25, 50, 75. Therefore, it’s crucial to consider these patterns when trying to delete the minimum number of digits.\nApproach The core idea is to check how many minimum deletions are required for each of the four special last two-digit patterns (00, 25, 50, 75).\nWe can do this by iterating through the string in reverse order and checking how many digits do not match with each pattern, keeping track of the minimum number of deletions for each.\nAnalyzing Possible Endings: A number that is divisible by 25 must have one of the four possible endings: ‘00’, ‘25’, ‘50’, ‘75’. Reverse Traversal of String: Traverse the string from right to left, keeping flags for the presence of ‘5’ and ‘0’. Using these flags, look for possible endings ‘00’, ‘25’, ‘50’, ‘75’. Operation Count: During the traversal, count the minimum number of operations required to make the number special.

Finally, we can return the length of this list to get the total points. However, this approach has a risk of counting points multiple times when two cars overlap.\nHints \u0026 Tips Utilizing a set can prevent duplicate counting since sets do not allow duplicates.

Remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order and the array is re-indexed. The task is to determine and return the smallest possible length of nums after executing the operation as many times as you wish.\nNaive Solution One way to approach this problem would be to iterate through every possible pair of elements in nums to check if they satisfy the condition nums[i] \u003c nums[j]. Whenever a valid pair is found, remove them and restart the search. This method would be inefficient and would result in a high time complexity due to frequent list updates.\nHints \u0026 Tips Utilizing two pointers can help in efficiently determining the pairs to remove. Keep track of removed indices in a set to avoid duplication. Focus on removing the largest numbers since they have the most potential pairs. Approach The idea is to maintain two pointers: a slow pointer i starting from the beginning of the array and a fast pointer j starting from the middle of the array. Since the array is sorted, this ensures that the number at j is always greater than the number at i.\nTraverse the list with the two pointers.

If a cycle exists, use the algorithm’s phase 2 to find the starting point of the cycle which corresponds to our duplicate number.

If there’s a duplicate, it means there’s a cycle in this ’list’. Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm, often used for cycle detection in linked lists, can be applied to find the duplicate number.\nHow the cycle detection works Phase 1 (Finding intersection point): Use two pointers, one moving fast (two steps at a time) and one moving slow. If there’s a cycle, they’ll eventually meet at some point. Phase 2 (Finding entry point of cycle): Move the fast pointer back to the start and advance both pointers at the same speed. The point where they meet again is the beginning of the cycle or, in this context, our duplicate number.

For this problem, instead of a depth-first traversal, the solution employs an iterative approach using a stack. Approach We can visualize this problem as a directed graph traversal task. Every ticket is a directed edge between two airports. The challenge is to find a path that uses all the directed edges and starts from JFK.\nThe stack is an essential data structure for this solution, and here’s why:\nA stack helps in maintaining the path. When visiting an airport, we’re not sure if this path will lead to a solution (because it might end up in a dead-end). Hence, pushing the airports to the stack gives us the flexibility to backtrack easily (by popping out the last visited airport) if we reach a dead-end.\nWhen all destinations from an airport are exhausted, it means we have found the end of that particular path. At this moment, by adding the airport to our final result and removing it from the stack, we backtrack to find the remaining itinerary.\nThe graph for this solution is a dictionary (specifically, a defaultdict for ease of handling non-existing keys). The keys of this dictionary are the source airports, and the values are a list of destination airports. Importantly, these destinations are sorted in reverse lexicographical order because we will be utilizing the pop() function to retrieve and remove the last element from these lists. This ensures that we always get the smallest lexical destination available without any extra computational overhead.\nSteps Convert the given list of tickets into a graph where each node (airport) points to a list of its destinations. Sort the destinations in reverse lexicographical order to aid in retrieving the smallest lexical order when using pop(). Use a stack to iteratively traverse the graph, always trying to go to the smallest lexical destination possible. When stuck at a node (airport) with no unvisited outbound paths, add it to the final itinerary. Continue the process until the stack is empty.

If no such index exists, return -1.\nNaive Solution A naive approach would be to iterate over each index and for each index, calculate the sum of elements to the left and right of the index. If the sums are equal, return the index. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) which makes it inefficient for larger inputs.\nHints \u0026 Tips A more optimized solution would use the prefix and suffix sum concept. Prefix sum is the sum of all elements to the left of the index, and suffix sum is the sum of all elements to the right of the index.

While this would solve the problem, it isn’t the most efficient way.\nHints \u0026 Tips You can use pointers and mathematical calculations to accomplish the task in a more efficient manner.\nApproach To solve this problem, you first need to calculate the length of the original list.

The remainder of the division will help you distribute the “extra” nodes among the first few parts.\nSteps Count the total number of nodes in the list. Call it n. Calculate the base length of each part as batch_len = n // k and find the number of “extra nodes” as extra_nodes = n % k. Initialize an array arr to store the head node of each part. Loop through k times to create k parts. Use the base length and distribute the extra nodes as you go. Debugging Step-by-Step Start with current = head.

Each asteroid has a size (given by its absolute value) and a direction it’s moving in (given by its sign: positive for right, negative for left). All asteroids move at the same speed. Your task is to determine the final state of the asteroids after all collisions have been resolved.\nTwo important points to note:\nWhen two asteroids of different directions meet, the smaller one explodes. If they are of the same size, both explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet and thus, never explode each other. Naive Solution One straightforward approach would be to iterate through the array repeatedly. During each iteration, whenever you find two consecutive asteroids moving towards each other (i.e., a positive value followed by a negative value), remove the smaller one (or both if they are of the same size). Keep iterating until no such pairs are found. However, this approach can be very inefficient, especially for larger arrays.\nHints \u0026 Tips To solve this problem more efficiently, consider using a data structure that allows us to easily handle the asteroids in the order they are encountered, but can also backtrack when necessary. This hints at using a stack.\nApproach Use a stack to simulate the asteroid collisions:\nTraverse the list of asteroids. If the asteroid is moving right (positive value), push it onto the stack. If the asteroid is moving left (negative value), then: While the top of the stack is positive and less than the absolute value of the current asteroid, pop elements from the stack (indicating that the asteroids have collided and exploded). If the stack is empty or the top is negative, push the current asteroid onto the stack. If the top of the stack is a positive number greater than the absolute value of the current asteroid, just ignore the current asteroid (it has exploded). If the top of the stack has the same value as the absolute value of the current asteroid, pop the top (both asteroids have exploded). Steps Initialize an empty stack. Traverse the asteroid array. For each asteroid: If it’s positive, push it onto the stack. If it’s negative: While the stack isn’t empty and the top of the stack is positive and less than the absolute value of the current asteroid, pop the stack.

Glasses are stacked in a pyramid, with each row having one more glass than the previous. When champagne is poured into the top glass and it overflows, the overflowed champagne is split equally between the two glasses below. The objective is to determine how full a specified glass will be after pouring a given amount of champagne.\nNaive Solution One could imagine a simulation, where we pour champagne into the top glass and then, glass-by-glass, simulate the overflow until we reach the desired glass. This approach, though conceptually simple, is computationally expensive and will not scale efficiently.\nHints \u0026 Tips Utilizing a Dynamic Programming approach allows for efficient computation. The key realization is that each glass only receives overflow from the glass directly above and the glass above and to the left. Therefore, by working row-by-row, we can calculate the overflow for each glass efficiently.\nApproach To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. Imagine you’re looking at the champagne tower from the top. Each glass receives champagne from the one(s) above it. The relationship between glasses can be broken down as follows:\nParent-Child Relationship: Each glass has a direct influence on the two glasses directly below it (child glasses). If a glass has an excess amount of champagne, it distributes this excess equally to its two child glasses.\nCalculating Overflow: For any glass (starting from top), if the amount of champagne in it exceeds its capacity (which is 1 unit), then the overflow is given by (amount - 1) / 2. This is because each glass can hold up to 1 unit of champagne, and any excess will be split equally between its two child glasses.\nPropagation: We start our simulation from the top of the tower. After pouring the champagne into the top glass, we calculate its overflow and propagate this overflow to its child glasses. We continue this process row by row until we have processed the entire tower or until we have processed up to the row of our query. This propagation ensures that every glass in the tower has the correct amount of champagne accounting for all the overflow from the glasses above it.\nEfficiency: By using a 2D array to simulate the tower and processing each glass only once, we can calculate the amount of champagne in the queried glass in an efficient manner. This avoids the need for complex simulations or recursive calculations.\nSteps Initialize the Tower: Create a 2D array representing the glasses. Pour the given amount into the top glass: [[poured], [0,0], [0,0,0], ...] Simulate the Pour: For each glass, calculate how much overflows, and distribute this overflow to the glasses below. Return the Result: After completing the simulation, return the amount in the specified glass. If it’s more than 1 (the capacity of a glass), return 1. Solution def champagneTower(poured, query_row, query_glass): tower = [[0] * k for k in range(1, query_row + 3)] # query_row + 3 for children update tower[0][0] = poured for row in range(query_row + 1): for col in range(row + 1): overflow = (tower[row][col] - 1.0) / 2.0 if overflow \u003e 0: # update children tower[row + 1][col] += overflow tower[row + 1][col + 1] += overflow return min(1, tower[query_row][query_glass]) Your browser does not support the video tag.

An array graph is provided where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge. The objective is to determine the length of the shortest path that visits every node.\nIt’s permissible to start and stop at any node, revisit nodes multiple times, and reuse edges.\nNaive Solution A naive approach would be to attempt all possible paths (brute force) until all nodes are visited. This would involve significant computational power and time, especially for larger graphs.\nHints \u0026 Tips State Compression: The visited state of nodes can be represented using binary numbers. Breadth-First Search: BFS can be used to explore the graph systematically. Approach Instead of the brute force approach, a more refined BFS can be applied. The BFS is enhanced using two techniques:\nState Compression: Rather than tracking visited nodes for each path with a set or list, represent them with a binary number. This efficient way compresses the state and avoids redundancy. Double-ended Queue: An efficient way to explore BFS paths using deque which allows operations from both ends. Steps Use BFS for exploration. Encode the visited state of nodes with binary numbers. Utilize a double-ended queue storing the nodes, their states, and steps taken.

You are required to find and return the kth letter (1-indexed) on the decoded tape.\nNaive Solution A straightforward solution would involve constructing the entire decoded tape and then simply accessing the kth character. However, this is impractical given the constraints, as the size of the decoded string can become extremely large.\nHints \u0026 Tips We can work backward from the desired index k. It is possible to determine the sequence of characters without decoding the entire string. Approach Instead of trying to build the entire string, which might be vast, we can work in reverse.

It does this by shifting larger elements one position ahead of their current position, making room for the new element.\ndef insertion_sort(array): for i in range(1, len(array)): value = array[i] while i \u003e 0 and array[i - 1] \u003e value: array[i] = array[i - 1] i -= 1 array[i] = value return array Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. It continues this process until the whole array is sorted, hence effectively moving the smallest unsorted element to its correct position in each iteration.\ndef selection_sort(array): for i in range(len(array) - 1): min_value = i for j in range(i + 1, len(array)): if array[j] \u003c array[min_value]: min_value = j temp = array[min_value] array[min_value] = array[i] array[i] = temp return array Merge sort sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, recursively sorting those halves, and then merging them back together in sorted order.\nIf the array has more than one element, find the middle of the array. Divide the array into two halves using the middle index: the left half (left_half) and the right half (right_half). Recursively sort both halves by calling merge_sort on left_half and right_half. Merge the sorted halves back into the original array. The merge operation walks through left_half and right_half, and at each step, it copies the smaller element from either left_half or right_half into the original array. If there are any remaining elements in left_half or right_half after one has been fully copied back into the array, those elements are copied over. This happens because those remaining elements are guaranteed to be larger than all elements already copied back into the array. First more simple example of merging already sorted two arrays:\nMerge sorted arrays:\ndef merge(left_ar, right_ar): res = [] left_index, right_index = 0 while left_index \u003c len(left_ar) and right_index \u003c len(right_ar): if left_ar[left_index] \u003c right_ar[right_index]: res.append(left_ar[left_index]) left_index += 1 else: res.append(right_ar[right_index]) right_index += 1 res += left_ar[left_index:] + right_ar[right_index:] def merge_sort(array): mid = len(array) / 2 left_ar = array[:mid] right_ar = array[mid:] return merge(left_ar, right_ar) Sort array:\ndef merge_sort(array): if len(array) \u003e 1: # Only sort if array is larger than 1 mid = len(array) // 2 # middle of the array # Split the array into two halves left_half = array[:mid] right_half = array[mid:] # Recursively sort both halves merge_sort(left_half) merge_sort(right_half) left_index = right_index = merged_index = 0 # Merge sorted halves back into the original array while left_index \u003c len(left_half) and right_index \u003c len(right_half): if left_half[left_index] \u003c= right_half[right_index]: array[merged_index] = left_half[left_index] left_index += 1 else: array[merged_index] = right_half[right_index] right_index += 1 merged_index += 1 # If any elements left in either half, append them to the array while left_index \u003c len(left_half): array[merged_index] = left_half[left_index] left_index += 1 merged_index += 1 while right_index \u003c len(right_half): array[merged_index] = right_half[right_index] right_index += 1 merged_index += 1 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Because this is the first sum, it is also the current maximum; thus, save it in the variable maximumSum.

The right pointer keeps moving to the right until it cannot move to the right (the specific conditions depend on the topic). When the right pointer reaches the far right, start to move the left pointer to release the left boundary of the window.\nUsage: Use two pointers to iterate the input data. Generally, both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant interval.\nPractice questions Two pointers intro Two-Pass Approach The two-pass approach is a common algorithmic pattern used to solve problems by going through the data twice. In the first pass, you gather some information that you’ll use in the second pass to solve the problem. Here is an explanation of the two-pass approach with two examples.\nFirst Pass: Gather Information\nThe first pass is used to collect some information from the data that will be useful to solve the problem. This could involve counting the occurrence of items, finding the maximum or minimum value, or performing some other calculation that will help in the second pass. Second Pass: Solve the Problem\nUsing the information gathered in the first pass, you can now go through the data again to solve the problem. Let’s go through two examples to understand this approach better.\nExample 1: Finding the Relative Rank of Scores\nYou have a list of scores and you want to find out the relative rank of each score in descending order.\nFirst Pass: Sort the list in descending order. Second Pass: Create a new list with the rank of each score in the original list. scores = [95, 85, 90, 100] sorted_scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True) ranking = {score: i + 1 for i, score in enumerate(sorted_scores)} for score in scores: print(\"Score:\", score, \"Rank:\", ranking[score]) Output:\nScore: 95 Rank: 2 Score: 85 Rank: 4 Score: 90 Rank: 3 Score: 100 Rank: 1 Example 2: Find if there’s a pair of numbers in an array that add up to a target value\nFirst Pass: Create a diccionario that keeps track of the occurrence of each number in the list. Second Pass: For each number in the array, check if there is another number in the diccionario that adds up to the target value. nums = [2, 3, 7, 11, 15] target = 9 counter = {} for num in nums: counter[num] = counter.get(num, 0) + 1 for num in nums: diff = target - num if diff in counter: if diff != num or counter[num] \u003e 1: print(\"Pair:\", (num, diff)) break Output:\nPair: (2, 7) In both examples, the first pass through the data gathered information that was then used in the second pass to solve the problem.\nPrefix Sums Usage: The prefix sums algorithm is a powerful technique that can simplify problems that require frequent computation of sums over subarrays or subtrees. As with all algorithms, practice is key. Try to identify problems where this algorithm can be applied, and it’ll soon become a natural tool in your algorithmic toolkit.\nAt its core, the idea behind the prefix sums algorithm is to preprocess an array of numbers such that you can efficiently answer queries about the sum of elements in a given subarray.\nImagine you’re given an array of numbers, and you want to know the sum of numbers between the indices i and j (inclusive). If you sum up the numbers every time you receive such a query, your solution will be slow. This is where prefix sums come into play.\nAbstract Example\nConsider an array arr:\narr = [a, b, c, d, e] The prefix sum array prefix_arr, for the above array would be:\nprefix_arr = [a, a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c+d, a+b+c+d+e] arr = [1, 3, 4, 8, 6, 1, 4, 2] prefix_arr = [1, 4, 8, 16, 22, 23, 27, 29] Now, to find the sum between indices i and j (inclusive) in array arr, you can simply take:\nprefix_arr[j] - prefix_arr[i-1] (Note: If i=0, then it’s just prefix_arr[j])\nExample: Prefix Sums on an Array\ndef prefix_sums(arr): n = len(arr) prefix_arr = [0] * (n) prefix_arr[0] = arr[0] for i in range(1, n): prefix_arr[i] = prefix_arr[i-1] + arr[i] return prefix_arr # Using the prefix sum array def sum_from_i_to_j(prefix_arr, i, j): if i == 0: return prefix_arr[j] return prefix_arr[j] - prefix_arr[i-1] arr = [2, 3, 7, 1, 5] prefix_arr = prefix_sums(arr) print(sum_from_i_to_j(prefix_arr, 1, 3)) # Output: 11 Python Example: Prefix Sums on a TreeNode\nFirstly, let’s define a binary tree:\nclass TreeNode: def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None): self.value = value self.left = left self.right = right Now, we’ll modify the tree such that each node will contain the sum of all nodes in its left subtree plus its own value:\ndef prefix_sum_tree(node): if not node: return 0 left_sum = prefix_sum_tree(node.left) # Store prefix sum in the node's value node.value += left_sum prefix_sum_tree(node.right) return node.value + (node.right.value if node.right else 0) # Example root = TreeNode(5, TreeNode(3, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(4)), TreeNode(8)) prefix_sum_tree(root) For the above example, the left child of the root (i.e., the node with value 3) will be updated to 8 (2 + 3 + 4), since 2 and 4 are the left children’s values.\nDynamic programming (DP) Breadth First Search (BFS) BFS on Tree:\nfrom collections import deque class TreeNode: def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None): self.val = val self.left = left self.right = right def bfs_tree(root): queue = deque([root]) while queue: node = queue.popleft() print(node.val, end=' ') if node.left: queue.append(node.left) if node.right: queue.append(node.right) root = TreeNode(1) root.left = TreeNode(2) root.right = TreeNode(3) root.left.left = TreeNode(4) root.left.right = TreeNode(5) bfs_tree(root) BFS on Graph:\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque class Graph: def __init__(self): self.graph = defaultdict(list) def add_edge(self, u, v): self.graph[u].append(v) def bfs(self, start): visited = set() queue = deque([start]) while queue: node = queue.popleft() if node not in visited: print(node, end=' ') visited.add(node) for neighbor in self.graph[node]: if neighbor not in visited: queue.append(neighbor) g = Graph() g.add_edge(0, 1) g.add_edge(0, 2) g.add_edge(1, 2) g.add_edge(2, 0) g.add_edge(2, 3) g.add_edge(3, 3) g.bfs(2) Depth-first search (DFS) DFS on Tree:\ndef dfs(root, target): if root is None: return None if root.val == target: return root left = dfs(root.left, target) if left is not None: return left return dfs(root.right, target) DFS on Graph:\ndef dfs(root, visited): for neighbor in get_neighbors(root): if neighbor in visited: continue visited.add(neighbor) dfs(neighbor, visited) DFS on two-dimensional array:\nLet’s imagine you have a big maze made of walls and corridors, and you want to find a way from the entrance to the exit. You can put a robot at the entrance, and you want to tell the robot what to do to find the exit.\nThe first thing you might tell the robot is to always go as far as it can in one direction before turning. This is what depth-first search does.\nThe robot starts at the entrance and goes as far as it can down the first corridor it finds.\nIf it comes to a dead end, it goes back to the last intersection it passed and tries the next corridor. If it comes to the exit, it stops and says “I found the exit!”. Example:\n# Define the maze as a two-dimensional array maze = [ ['.', '.', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'], ['#', '.', '.', '.', '#', '.', '.', '#'], ['#', '.', '#', '.', '#', '.', '.', '#'], ['#', '.', '.', '.', '.', '#', '.', '#'], ['#', '#', '#', '#', '.', '#', '.', '#'], ['#', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '#'], ['#', '.', '#', '#', '#', '#', '.', '.'], ['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '.'], ] # Define the starting point and the destination start = (0, 0) end = (len(maze)-1, len(maze[0])-1) # Define a function to find the exit using depth-first search def dfs(current, visited): # Mark the current cell as visited visited.add(current) # Base case: If we've reached the destination, return True # or other condition if current == end: return True # Try all possible directions from the current cell for delta in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]: next_cell = (current[0] + delta[0], current[1] + delta[1]) if is_valid_cell(next_cell) and next_cell not in visited: if dfs(next_cell, visited): return **True** # If we couldn't find the exit from this cell, backtrack to the previous cell return False # Call the depth-first search function with the starting point and an empty set of visited cells visited = set() if dfs(start, visited): print(\"I found the exit!\") else: print(\"I couldn't find the exit.\") Base template:\ndef dfs(matrix, row, col, visited): # Check if the current cell is out of bounds or has already been visited if ( row \u003c 0 or row \u003e= len(matrix) or col \u003c 0 or col \u003e= len(matrix[0]) or visited[row][col]: ) return # Mark the current cell as visited visited[row][col] = True # Define the possible directions to move (right, down, left, up) directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] # Iterate through the directions and call DFS recursively on neighboring cells for step_row, step_col in directions: new_row, new_col = row + step_row, step_col + dc dfs(matrix, new_row, new_col, visited) Backtracking Based on Depth-first search (DFS)\nUsage:\nFinding all permutations, combinations, subsets and solving sudoku are classic combinatorial problems.\nImagine you are trying to solve a puzzle, like a Sudoku. When you are solving a puzzle, sometimes you reach a point where you can’t make any more progress using the current path. That’s when you need to backtrack.\nBacktracking is a general algorithmic technique that is used to find all (or some) solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates, and checking if the candidate is feasible or not. If the candidate is not feasible, the algorithm goes back (backtracks) to the previous step and tries again with a different candidate. The process continues until a solution is found, or all candidates have been tried.\nBacktracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.\nBacktracking algorithm is derived from the Recursion algorithm, with the option to revert if a recursive solution fails, i.e. in case a solution fails, the program traces back to the moment where it failed and builds on another solution. So basically it tries out all the possible solutions and finds the correct one.\nBacktracking == DFS on a tree\nHowto:\nBacktracking is drawing tree When drawing the tree, bear in mind: how do we know if we have reached a solution? how do we branch (generate possible children)? Example:\nLet’s say we want to generate all possible combinations of 1, 2, and 3 of length 2. The possible combinations are: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2).\nThis process generates all possible combinations of length k:\ndef backtrack(nums, path, res, k): # nums: the list of available numbers # path: the current path of selected numbers # res: the list of all valid combinations # k: the length of each combination if len(path) == k: # base case res.append(path[:]) return for i in range(len(nums)): path.append(nums[i]) backtrack(nums[:i] + nums[i+1:], path, res, k) path.pop() nums = [1, 2, 3] k = 2 res = [] backtrack(nums, [], res, k) print(res) # [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2]] Algorithm:\nWe start with an empty path and empty result list. We loop through the available numbers (1, 2, 3) and add the first number to the path. We make a recursive call to backtrack with the remaining numbers (2, 3) and a path that includes the first number (e.g., [1]). This adds all possible combinations of length k-1 with the first number. After the recursive call, we remove the first number from the path. We repeat this process for the other available numbers, generating all possible combinations of length k. When we reach the base case (len(path) == k), we add the current path to the result list. We return the result list of all possible combinations. The base case is when the length of the path is equal to k. At this point, we add the current path to the result list and return.\nThe recursive case involves looping through the available numbers, adding the current number to the path, making a recursive call with the remaining numbers, and removing the current number from the path after the recursive call.\npath:\nIn the backtrack function, path refers to the list of numbers that have been selected so far to form a valid combination.\nInitially, path is an empty list []. In each recursive call, a number from nums is selected and added to path.\nFor example, if nums = [1, 2, 3] and the current path is [1], the function will call backtrack([2, 3], [1], res, k) to consider all possible combinations with 1 in the first position, followed by all possible combinations of length k-1 of [2, 3] in the second position.\nOnce all possible combinations with 1 in the first position have been explored, the number 1 will be removed from path, and the function will try the next number from nums, which in this case is 2. The function continues in this way until all valid combinations of length k have been found and added to the res list.\nProblem examples:\nLeetCode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number [LeetCode 22. Generate Parentheses] [LeetCode 46. Permutations] Example of LeetCode 78 problem:\nAlgorithm:\nWe define a backtrack function named backtrack(first, curr) which takes the index of first element to add and a current combination as arguments.\nIf the current combination is done, we add the combination to the final output.\nOtherwise, we iterate over the indexes i from first to the length of the entire sequence n.\nAdd integer nums[i] into the current combination curr. Proceed to add more integers into the combination: backtrack(i + 1, curr). Backtrack by removing nums[i] from curr. class Solution: def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -\u003e List[List[int]]: def backtrack(first = 0, curr = []): # if the combination is done if len(curr) == k: output.append(curr[:]) return for i in range(first, n): # add nums[i] into the current combination curr.append(nums[i]) # use next integers to complete the combination backtrack(i + 1, curr) # backtrack curr.pop() output = [] n = len(nums) for k in range(n + 1): backtrack() return output # [ [], # [1], [3], [4], # [1, 3], [1, 4], [3, 4], # [1, 3, 4] # ] Dutch National Flag problem The Dutch National Flag problem is a sorting problem that asks us to sort an array of colors, like a bunch of different colored socks. We want to put all the socks of the same color together in the array.\nThe colors in this problem are represented by numbers. We use the numbers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the colors red, white, and blue. So, we have an array of numbers, and we want to sort them in such a way that all the 0's are at the beginning of the array, then all the 1's, and finally all the 2's are at the end.\nFor example, if we have an array [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0], we want to sort it so that it becomes [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2].\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a technique called the Dutch National Flag algorithm. The idea behind this algorithm is to use three pointers: a low pointer, a mid pointer, and a high pointer.\nThe low pointer starts at the beginning of the array, the high pointer starts at the end of the array, and the mid pointer starts at the beginning of the array.\nWe then iterate through the array with the mid pointer.\nIf the value at the mid pointer is 0, we swap it with the value at the low pointer and increment both pointers. - If the value at the mid pointer is 1, we leave it where it is and just increment the mid pointer. If the value at the mid pointer is 2, we swap it with the value at the high pointer and decrement the high pointer. We keep doing this until the mid pointer passes the high pointer, at which point the array is sorted.\nSo, in our sock example, we start with the low pointer at the beginning of the array, the mid pointer also at the beginning of the array, and the high pointer at the end of the array. Then, we iterate through the array with the mid pointer, swapping socks as needed until the array is sorted by color.\nResources https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/ https://algo.monster/templates https://interviewnoodle.com/grokking-leetcode-a-smarter-way-to-prepare-for-coding-interviews-e86d5c9fe4e1 data structures Competitive Programming Library Algorithms for Competitive Programming Solutions to Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition ","description":"LeetCode Cookbook - Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","uri":"/en/tracks/algorithms-101/algorithms/"},{"content":"About Documentation User Guide API Gateway provides the opportunity to create and expand your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any size.\nAPI endpoints can be cached to accommodate for frequent similar requests.\nUse Cases Build a network for micros­ervices archit­ectures.\nAmazon CloudWatch metrics - Collects near-real-time metrics Examples: 4XXError (client-side errors), 5XXError(server-side errors), CacheHitCount Amazon CloudWatch Logs - Debug issues related to request execution AWS CloudTrail - Record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in API Gateway AWS X-Ray - Trace your request across different AWS Services Digests Concepts REST API, HTTP API, WebSocket API\nDeployment - point-in-time snapshot of your API Gateway API\nEndpoint - https://api-id.execute-api.region-id.amazonaws.com\nEdge-optimized Private Regional Stage - A logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API.

Use an AWS Lambda function as the backend and an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data store Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application backed by an Amazon RDS database. Configure the application to allow long-lived TCP/IP sockets. Create a GraphQL endpoint in Amazon API Gateway. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data store. Enable WebSocket on Amazon CloudFront. Use an AWS Lambda function as the origin and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as the data store Explanation AWS AppSync simplifies application development by letting users create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources. AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to get the exact data they need.\nAWS AppSync allows users to build scalable applications, including those requiring real-time updates, on a range of data sources, including Amazon DynamoDB. In Amazon API Gateway, users can create a WebSocket API as a stateful frontend for an AWS service (such as AWS Lambda or DynamoDB) or for an HTTP endpoint.\nThe WebSocket API invokes the backend based on the content of the messages it receives from client applications. Unlike a REST API, which receives and responds to requests, a WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client applications and the backend.\n1, 2\nQ3 A company is providing services to many downstream consumers. Each consumer may connect to one or more services. This has resulted in complex architecture that is difficult to manage and does not scale well. The company needs a single interface to manage these services to consumers\nWhich AWS service should be used to refactor this architecture?\nAWS X-Ray Amazon SQS AWS Lambda Amazon API Gateway Explanation 4\nQ4 Veronika is writing a REST service that will add items to a shopping list. The service is built on Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda integrations. The shopping list stems are sent as query string parameters in the method request.\nHow should Veronika convert the query string parameters to arguments for the Lambda function?\nEnable request validation Include the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function Change the integration type Create a mapping template Explanation API Gateway mapping template\n4\nQ5 A developer is designing a full-stack serverless application. Files for the website are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Lambda functions that use Amazon API Gateway endpoints return results from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The developer must create a solution that securely provides registration and authentication for the application while minimizing the amount of configuration.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?\nCreate an Amazon Cognito user pool and an app client. Configure the app client to use the user pool and provide the hosted web UI provided for sign-up and sign-in. Configure an Amazon Cognito identity pool. Map the users with IAM roles that are configured to access the S3 bucket that stores the website. Configure and launch an Amazon EC2 instance to set up an identity provider with an Amazon Cognito user pool. Configure the user pool to provide the hosted web UI for sign-up and sign-in. Create an IAM policy that allows access to the website that is stored in the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to an IAM group. Add IAM users to the group. Explanation 2\nQ6 A company has moved a legacy on-premises application to AWS by performing a lift and shift. The application exposes a REST API that can be used to retrieve billing information. The application is running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application code cannot support concurrent invocations. Many clients access the API, and the company adds new clients all the time.\nA developer is concerned that the application might become overwhelmed by too many requests. The developer needs to limit the number of requests to the API for all current and future clients. The developer must not change the API, the application, or the client code.\nWhat should the developer do to meet these requirements?\nPlace the API behind an Amazon API Gateway API. Set the server-side throttling limits. Place the API behind a Network Load Balancer. Set the target group throttling limits. Place the API behind an Application Load Balancer. Set the target group throttling limits. Place the API behind an Amazon API Gateway API. Set the per-client throttling limits.

It was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems” in 1978.\nCalculating Formula ATR is calculated based on the true range (TR), which is the maximum of the following:\nCurrent High less the current Low Absolute value of (Current High less the previous Close) Absolute value of (Current Low less the previous Close) The ATR is then the moving average over a given period of the TR.\nATR = Average(TR, N)\nFor the first calculation of the ATR, it’s simply the average of the TR over a specified period. But for subsequent calculations, it’s the average of the previous ATR value and the current TR.\nPros and Cons Pros:\nATR does not provide a directional bias, it purely measures volatility. It can be used in all markets such as stocks, forex, commodities etc. ATR adapts to changing market conditions, increasing during market turbulence and decreasing in calm markets. Cons:\nATR does not indicate price direction, only volatility. During periods of rapid price changes, ATR may experience sharp increases, reflecting the inherent volatility in the price series. Example of signals ATR does not provide trading signals like other oscillators such as RSI or MACD. It provides a gauge of market volatility which can assist in stop loss placement or determining trade size.\nTrue Positive:\nIn a trending market, ATR can help a trader place their stop loss further away during high volatility periods and closer during low volatility periods, reducing the likelihood of being stopped out prematurely.\nFalse Positive:\nIn a ranging market, a sudden price breakout can cause a sharp increase in ATR, possibly leading to an unnecessarily wide stop loss if the breakout turns out to be a false one.\nUse in Real Trading In real trading, ATR can be used in conjunction with other indicators for better signal confirmation. For example, ATR can be used with a trend following system to manage stop losses. As ATR increases, your stop loss can be placed further from your entry point allowing for market volatility.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"ATR Trading Indicator","title":"Average True Range (ATR) - Volatility Indicator","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/atr/"},{"content":"Preface For Amplify project I use eu-west region github repo has to be ready private or public New project goto https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=eu-west-1#/\nNew app → Host web app → Github\nAdd access to github repo Select repository Come back to Amplify and try again to choose repo Click Next\nUpdate amplify.yml for node.js project\nversion: 1 frontend: phases: preBuild: commands: - yarn install build: commands: - yarn run build artifacts: baseDirectory: build files: - '**/*' cache: paths: - node_modules/**/* Next → Save and deploy Amplify starts to build project and generates project url.\nOnce build done you can open project.\n","description":"AWS Amplify - Initial setup with Github","title":"AWS Amplify - project setup with Github","uri":"/en/posts/cloud-exam-quizz/amplify-setup-project/"},{"content":"You can use any custom domain with Amplify and no need register it with AWS Route53.\nI am adding domain at the setup app stage.

What is a Binary Tree?\nA binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.\n2. Representing a Binary Tree in Python\nTo represent a binary tree in Python, we can create a class called Node to represent each node in the tree. Each node will have a value and references to its left and right children.\nIf a node doesn’t have a left or right child, the reference will be set to None. Here’s an example implementation:\nclass Node: def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None): self.value = value self.left = left self.right = right On this step None will look like this:\n3. Adding Nodes to a Binary Tree\nOnce we have a representation of a node, we can start adding nodes to the tree to create the structure of the binary tree.\nTo add a node, we need to find the correct position in the tree where the new node should be added. This is typically done by starting at the root node and comparing the value of the new node to the value of the current node.\nIf the new node’s value is less than the current node’s value, we move to the left child. If the new node’s value is greater than the current node’s value, we move to the right child. We repeat this process until we find a position where there is no left or right child (i.e., the current node is a leaf node), and we can add the new node there.\nHere’s an example implementation of a function to add a node to a binary tree:\ndef insert(root, value): if root is None: return Node(value) # basicaly create a new root Node if value \u003c root.value: root.left = insert(root.left, value) else: root.right = insert(root.right, value) return root Visualize Binary Tree\n4.

It provides a relative definition of high and low prices of a market instrument by creating a band of two standard deviations from a simple moving average (SMA).\nCalculating Formula Bollinger Bands consist of three lines:\nMiddle Line: 20-day simple moving average (SMA) Upper Band: 20-day SMA + (2 * 20-day standard deviation of price) Lower Band: 20-day SMA - (2 * 20-day standard deviation of price) The standard deviation measures how spread out the prices or returns of an asset are on average. It’s the most common way to gauge market volatility.\nPros and Cons Pros:\nBollinger Bands adjust themselves to market conditions. They can be used in all markets like stocks, forex, commodities, etc. The bands can provide signals for potential overbuying and overselling scenarios. Cons:\nDuring a strong trend, the price can remain at the extremes (upper or lower band) for a long time, leading to many false sell or buy signals. As a lagging indicator, Bollinger Bands might send a late signal, causing the trader to miss a big part of the trend. Example of signals Bollinger Bands are often used to identify potential buy and sell signals.\nBuy Signal: A common strategy is to buy when the price touches the lower Bollinger Band and exit when the price touches the moving average in the center of the bands.\nSell Signal: Conversely, a sell signal is present when the price touches the upper Bollinger Band and exit the position when it touches the moving average.\nTrue Positive:\nIn a ranging market, prices tend to bounce between the upper and lower band, correctly indicating good points to buy and sell.\nFalse Positive:\nIn a trending market, the price can touch the upper band (in an uptrend) or the lower band (in a downtrend) for extended periods, leading to potentially poor buy or sell signals.\nUse in Real Trading Bollinger Bands can be combined with other indicators for better signal confirmation.\nFor example, using it in conjunction with the RSI could help traders avoid false signals. When the price touches the upper band and the RSI indicates overbought conditions, there might be a good chance the price will decrease, indicating a sell signal.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"Bollinger Bands Trading Indicator","title":"Bollinger Bands - Volatility and Price Level Indicator","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/bollinger_bands/"},{"content":"\nBrewMate is a macOS GUI application that makes it easy to search for, install, and uninstall Homebrew casks.

We want to configure an LB to create a central point of access to our application, and we also want to configure our architecture in a way that users can only access the application through the ELB.\nIn the end, we should have a solution similar to this one:\nTo do that we will have to create and configure a Classic Load Balancer, and properly configure the needed Security Groups to make sure that our application will work as expected.\nCreating a Classic Load Balancer and Registering EC2 Instances A Classic Load Balancer allows traffic to be balanced across many Amazon EC2 instances, it performs this balancing at the request and connection level.\n1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter EC2, and click the EC2 result under Services:\n2. In the left-hand menu, under Load Balancing, click Load Balancers:\n3. To start creating your classic load balancer, click Create Load Balancer:\nThree tiles will be displayed detailing the different types of load balancer supported by Amazon EC2.\n4. At the bottom of the page, click Classic Load Balancer:\n5. In the Classic Load Balancer tile, click Create:\nA multi-step wizard will open allowing you to configure and customize your load balancer.\n6. Under Basic Configuration, enter the following values:\nLoad Balancer name: Enter classic-elb Enable advanced VPC configuration: checked Be aware there are limitations on the name field, only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and hyphens are allowed.\nCreate LB Inside lets you select which VPC you want the load balancer to be created in, leave this at the default.\nThe Create an internal load balancer option determines whether the load balancer can accept public internet traffic or not. If checked, the load balancer will have a private IP address and will only be able to accept traffic from another source inside the VPC.\nThe default Listener Configuration, listening on port eighty (HTTP), is all that is required for this lab.\n7. Under Select Subnets, click the plus icon next to each subnet.\nAs you click for each subnet, it will move from the Available subnets table, to the Selected subnets table:\nAn Availability Zone, often referred to as an AZ, helps make your infrastructure more reliable. You can think of each zone as a separate data center (in many cases they are exactly that), they are guaranteed to have redundant power, networking, and connectivity within an AWS region.\nTo learn more about regions, availability zones, and redundancy in AWS, visit the documentation here.\nEach subnet is mapped to one availability zone. It’s important to configure the selected subnets correctly. If a subnet containing an EC2 instance is not selected, the load balancer will not be able to communicate with that EC2 instance.\n8. To move to the next step of the wizard, click Next: Assign Security Groups:\n9. In the form, enter and select the following values:\nAssign a security group: Select Create a new security group Security group name: Enter elb-sg Description: Enter Security group for the classic load balancer You will see a default security group rule allowing traffic on port eighty.\n10. In the default security group rule, in the Source drop-down, select Anywhere:\n11. To advance to the next page of the wizard, click Next: Configure Security Settings:\nThis wizard step display’s a warning that your load balancer isn’t configured to use HTTPS or SSL.\nIt’s strongly recommended that you always enable encrypted traffic on your load balancers for security reasons. Configuring SSL is beyond the scope of this lab. If you would like to learn more about SSL and load balancing, it’s covered in the Using Elastic Load Balancing \u0026 EC2 Auto Scaling to Support AWS Workloads course.\n12. To move to the next wizard step, click Next: Configure Health Check:\n13. In the Ping Path field, replace the contents with /:\nBy default, the fields on this page specify that the health check will be performed using the HTTP protocol on port eighty. This means the load balancer will assume an instance is healthy when the instance returns a 200 OK response.\nThe Advanced Details allow you to further customize different aspects of the health check:\nResponse Timeout: How long to the load balancer should wait for a response from the EC2 instance. Interval: Amount of time between health checks. Unhealthy threshold: The number of consecutive failed healthy checks that must occur before the load balancer declares the EC2 instance unhealthy. Healthy threshold: The number of consecutive health checks that must occur before declaring an EC2 instance healthy. To learn more about Elastic Load Balancing health checks, see the AWS documentation here.\n14. To move to the next wizard step, click Next: Add EC2 Instances:\nThis step of the wizard displays the EC2 instances that currently exist and can be added to the load balancer:\n15. Select the instances named web-node:\nTake a look at the configuration options on this page:\nCross-Zone Load Balancing ensures that your LB distributes incoming requests evenly across all instances in its enabled Availability Zones. This means that the LB will ignore the default of round-robin and will also take into consideration the Availability Zone in which the instance is running. This reduces the need to maintain equivalent numbers of instances in each enabled Availability Zone and improves your application’s ability to handle the loss of one or more instances.\nConnection Draining is used to ensure that a Classic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy while keeping the existing connections open.\nLeave these options at their defaults.\n16. To advance to the next wizard step, click Next: Add Tags:\nIn a non-lab environment, it is best practice to add tags to resources you create. Tags help make managing, organizing, and filtering resources in AWS easier.\nTo read more about tagging resources in AWS, see this document from AWS.\n17. To proceed to the review step, click Review and Create:\nThis page allows you to review the load balancing settings you have configured:\n18. To create your load balancer, click Create:\nYou will see a notification that your load balancer has been successfully created:\n19. To return to the EC2 management console, click Close:\nConfiguring Security Groups for Load Balanced EC2 Instances 1. In the list of load balancers, ensure your load balancer is selected:\nYou will see some tabs beneath the list and the Description tab will be selected.\nThis tab shows general information about your load balancer.\n2. To view information about instances registered with this load balancer, click the Instances tab:\nYou will see the instances and availability zones listed:\nThe instances will have a status of InService. This means the load balancer is performing successful health checks on the instances.\nNote: If you see the Status as OutOfService then the instances are still be registered. Wait a minute or two and then click the refresh icon in the top-right corner.\n3. To see the DNS of your load balancer, click the Description tab.\n4. Copy the domain name from the value of the DNS name field:\nWarning: Don’t include the (A Record) part of the value when copying.\n5. In a new browser tab, paste the domain name, and press enter.\nYou will see an instance Id displayed:\nNote: Your instance Id will be different.\nAn application has been pre-installed on the EC2 instances that will respond to web requests with the instance Id of the instance serving the request.\nTo see the Id of the other EC2 instance, refresh the page. If the Id doesn’t change, you may need to open an incognito or private browsing tab and visit the DNS name again.\nSeeing the Id change shows that the load balancer is working as expected, routing traffic to both registered instances.\nLeave this tab open and remember this is the tab for the load balancer, you will use it again later in the lab step.\n6. In the left-hand menu, under Instances, click Instances:\nYou will see two instances named web-node with a status of Running:\n7. Select one of the instances:\nYou will see tabs displayed below the list of instances.\n8. In the Details tab, in the Public IPv4 DNS field, click the copy icon:\nThe public DNS name of the EC2 has been copied to your clipboard.\n9. In a new browser tab, paste the DNS name and press enter.\nYou will see an instance Id displayed again.\nHowever, this time, because you are accessing the instance directly if you refresh or visit the DNS name in an incognito or private browsing tab, the Id won’t change.\nNote that you are accessing the instance directly, this is allowed by the security group associated with the EC2 instances. Allowing load-balanced instances to be publicly accessible is a bad security practice, and there is rarely a good reason for it.\nIn the rest of this lab step, you will modify the EC2 instance’s security group to only allow traffic from the load balancer.\nLeave this browser tab open and remember this is the tab for an EC2 instance, you will use this tab again later.\nNavigate to Load Balancers in the EC2 Management Console. 11. Ensure the classic-elb load balancer is selected.\n12. In the Description tab, scroll down to the Security section:\nThis is the security group you configured when you created the load balancer.\n13. In the left-hand menu, under Network \u0026 Security, click Security Groups:\nYou will see a list of security groups:\n14. Select the SG which has the Group Name starting with cloudacademylabs- .\nThis is the security group of the EC2 instances.\nYou will see tabs displayed beneath the list.\n15. In the row of tabs, click Inbound rules:\n16. To modify the rules of this security group, click Edit inbound rules:\nYou want to allow only connections coming from the load balancer to the instances, however, the balancer doesn’t have a particular IP address associated with it so you can’t specify an IP address here. Instead, you will restrict the access by using the security group you created for the balancer.\nYou will change the current rule to deny access to anywhere and allow it only to members of the load balancer’s security group.\n17. Delete the existing rule, and create a new one whose Type is HTTP. In the Source drop-down, ensure Custom is selected and in the box next to it, select elb-sg:\n18. To save your changes, in the bottom-right, click Save rules:\nWith your rule saved, reload the browser tab with the DNS of the load balancer.\nThis will continue to work, you will see an instance Id displayed.\n19. Reload the browser tab with the DNS of an instance in the address bar:\nThe exact behavior will vary depending upon your web browser.\nMost likely you see the loading symbol in the browser tab spinning indefinitely:\nIf you wait long enough, your browser will report that it timed out trying to reach the instance:\nChecking Your Load Balancer’s Behavior During Instance Failures Navigate to Instances in the EC2 Management Console. You will see two instances named web-node listed.\n2. To stop an instance, right-click one of them.\n3. In the menu that appears, click Instance state, and then click Stop instance:\nYou will see a dialog box asking you to confirm that you want to stop the instance.\n4. To confirm, click Stop:\nThe instance’s Instance state column will change to Stopping. A few moments later you will see it changed to Stopped:\nStopping the instance will make it fail your load balancer’s health checks.\nNavigate to Load Balancers in the EC2 Management Console. 6. Ensure the classic-elb load balancer is selected.\n7. In the row of tabs below the load balancer list, click Instances:\nLook at the Status column in the instances table, one of the instances will still be InService, and the other will be OutOfService:\nThis means that there is only one instance serving the application, and therefore all the requests will be forwarded to the same instance.\nYou can test this behavior by clicking on the Description tab and accessing the DNS nameof the load balancer in a new browser tab. Your request will be served by the instance that you didn’t stop.\nLeave the browser tab with the load balancer’s DNS name open. You will test it again after starting the stopped instance.\n8. To start the stopped instance, in the left-hand menu, under Instances, click Instances:\n9. Right-click the stopped instance.\n10. Click Instance state, and click Start instance:\nNote: You can also access this menu using the Actions button in the top-right.\nThe Instance state column will change to Pending, and a few moments later, to Running.\nTest accessing the load balancer by it’s DNS name again. This time, you will see that both instances are serving requests.\nNote: You may need to open the load balancer’s domain name in an incognito or private browsing tab to see both instance Ids.\nMonitoring your Classic Load Balancer Navigate to Load Balancers in the EC2 Management Console. 2. In the list of load balancers, ensure the classic-elb load balancer is selected, and click the Monitoring tab:\nYou will see a number of graphs of different CloudWatch metrics.\nThe Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service reports metrics to CloudWatch only when requests are flowing through the load balancer. If there are requests flowing through the load balancer, the load balancing service measures and sends its metrics in sixty-second intervals. If there are no requests flowing through the load balancer, or no data for a metric, the metric is not reported.\nThere are a few metrics related to a Classic Load Balancer, and most are self-explanatory if you are familiar with HTTP requests. If some of them are unfamiliar to you, visit the Amazon AWS documentation to read more.\nThe metrics called HealthyHostCount, and UnHealthyHostCountwill count the number of Healthy and Unhealthy instances respectively. These metrics can be useful for you to identify a major problem in your AWS account. A healthy instance is one that is passing the health checks performed by the load balancer.\nYou could use CloudWatch Alarms to notify you when you have less than 2 instances running your application, though to be clear this is not a general rule: the number of instances that might identify a problem will vary depending on your environment.\nAlso notice that in these metrics, there is no way of seeing the Availability Zone to which the Healthy/Unhealthy instance belongs. In our lab, we stopped an instance for a few minutes, therefore you should be able to see something like this:\nIf the Healthy Hosts metric reaches zero, that means that people won’t see anything when accessing your load balancer, and it is probable that you have a big problem in your infrastructure.\nThe Average Latency metric might be useful to identify potential issues in your setup. Maybe everything is working in your application, but you notice an increase in this metric. If you haven’t changed anything in your application, that can be a potential issue - maybe you haven’t provisioned enough EC2 instances, or you even have lots of instances but they don’t have enough power to serve your increasing traffic.\nThe other metrics can be very useful for troubleshooting specific scenarios and will vary depending on your setup.\n","description":"tutorial how to create AWS Classic Load Balancer","title":"Create Classic Load Balancer","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/elasticloadbalancing/create-amazon-load-balancing/"},{"content":"Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket Introduction You can create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console.

When prompted, enter the Username and Password you saved in a text file earlier in this Lab Step.\nTip: The password generated by AWS is long and it is easy to make a typo when entering it. To avoid errors copy and paste the password.\n14. Change the repository directory name to ca-app:\nmv ca-app-\u003cUnique_string\u003e ca-app Note: Change ca-app-\u003cUnique_string\u003e to the name of your repository.\nThis won’t change the repository name. It will only simplify the instructions at the command-line by not having to enter your unique string following ca-app in this and later Lab Steps.\n15. Change into the directory:\ncd ca-app 16. Enter ls to get a quick overview of the project structure.\nThere are several files:\napp.js: JavaScript file that starts the server appspec.yml: Configuration file that instructs AWS CodeDeploy what steps to perform to deploy your application package.json: Metadata and dependencies related to your project README.md: Text file explaining the project template There is no need to get into the details of the file contents at this time. However, it is good to know that the appspec.yml file specifies scripts that run during the deployment of your application. The scripts are contained in one of the two project directories:\npublic: Static assets used for your application scripts: Scripts executed by AWS CodeDeploy during the deployment of your application Now you can get the server running on your development machine.\n17. Install the project dependencies using Node package manager (npm) and start the Node.js server:\nnpm install node app.js While the server is running you won’t be able to enter new commands. That won’t be a problem. Now you can test that the development server is serving the application.\nNavigate to Instances in the EC2 service in the AWS Console. 19. Select the instance named cloudacademylabs:\nIn the Description tab, you will see a field called Public DNS (IPv4).\n20. To copy the public DNS, click the click the copy icon under Public IPv4 DNS:\n21. Open a new browser taband paste the public DNS and append :3000 to the end and press enter:\nNow that you verified the application works on the development machine, you can make some code changes.\n22. Return to the SSH shell and press Ctrl+C to kill the running Node.js server.\n23. Enter the following multiline command at the shell prompt to update a file in the project:\necho 'var idx = Math.floor(new Date().getHours()); var body = document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0]; var idxStep = 1; var refreshRate = 1000; function adjustIdx() { if (idx \u003c= 0) { // Start increasing idx idxStep = 1; } else if (idx \u003e= 23) { // Start decreasing idx idxStep = -1; } idx += idxStep; body.className = \"heaven-\" + idx; } body.className = \"heaven-\" + idx; setInterval(adjustIdx, refreshRate);' \u003e public/js/set-background.js 24. Test the changes by running the server again with node app.js and refresh the browser tab with your development application.\nYou will see a similar page as the previous one, but the color will change roughly once a second.\n25. Stop the Node.js server with Ctrl+C.\n26. View the local repository status:\ngit status This tells you that you are on the master branch and working from the initial code commit. The output also shows the set-background.js file was modified. You need to add the file to stage it before committing.\n27. Add the modified file to the staged changes in the commit:\ngit add public/js/set-background.js 28. Commit the staged changes to the local repository and add a short message about the changes:\ngit commit -m \"animation\" 29. Push the changes in your local repository to the remote AWS CodeStar project repository so they are synchronized:\ngit push Now that you have made a change to your code, you will see how the changes are deployed in the next Lab Step.\nSummary In this Lab Step, you committed a code change to your AWS CodeStar project repository. You created the required credentials and tested the application on your development server.\nDeploying Your AWS CodeStar Project 1. Return to your AWS CodeStar project view.\nThere are a few things to notice since you were here last:\nYour commit is now visible in the Repository\u003e Most recent committile Your Monitoring \u003e CPUUtilization tile might show some spikes if your application has already been deployed Your Pipeline tab may show one of the pipeline stages In progress or you may see a recent timestamp inside each stage box telling you the new version has been deployed. If you missed the release flowing through the stages of the pipeline, click Release change and click Continue in the pop-up.\n2. To inspect the code, in the Repository tab, click the most recent Commit ID:\nYour commit Id will be different.\n3. Look at the code changes:\nAdditions appear in green and removals would appear in red, if any were present. This is an easy way to keep track of what is happening to the code in your AWS CodeStar project.\n4. Navigate back to the Pipeline tab. Click on AWS Code Deploy under Deploy:\nThis opens your application in AWS CodeDeploy:\nYou can see the Deployment Groups created for deploying your application. In this case there will be just one with a Nameending in -Env. The Statuscolumn will tell you if your last deployment Succeededor failed. The time of the Last attempted deployment and Last successful deployment are also recorded.\n5. Click the name of your deployment group beginning with ca-app:\nNotice that by default Rollback enabled is false. That means if your deployment fails, AWS CodeDeploy will not attempt to deploy the last successful version. That is something you might consider changing when you use AWS CodeStar for one of your projects.\n6. Scroll down the page and inspect the Deployment group deployment history section.\nEach deployment that was attempted to be deployed is recorded here along with a link to where the artifacts are located on Amazon S3.\n7. Click on the most recent deployment in the Deployment Id column:\nYour deployment will have a different deployment id.\nThis opens a page with details of the most recent deployment:\nDeployment status: shows the state of the deployment operation Deployment details: shows information similar to what you saw on the AWS CodeDeploy application page Revision details: shows information about the revision deployed, including the location in AWS S3 Deployment lifecycle events: tells you the start and end times as well as the Durationof the deployment 8. To view the deployment life-cycle events, click View events down the bottom:\n9. To view the events, scroll down to the event list:\nYou will see events similar to the above.\nIn case of a failed deployment, one of the events will record the failure and provide a link under the Logs column to investigate the command and logs related to the failure. If you recall, the appspec.yml file in the code project was used to instruct AWS CodeDeploy on how to deploy your application. Your project provides different scripts to run for some of the events listed in the table.\n10. Finally, return to the AWS CodeStar and click View application.\nYou will see the latest version of your application including the animation commit deployed and available to the world.\nManaging Your AWS CodeStar Project Team 1. Return to your AWS CodeStar project’s Overview and click on Add team members:\n2. Click on the Userdrop-down menu and click on Logan.\n3. Set the team member values for Logan to:\nEmail address: test@cloudacademy.com Project Role: Contributor Remote Access: Checked (This allows the team member to upload an SSH public key to connect to EC2 instances) The difference between the default Project Roles is:\nViewer: Access to the project dashboard and able to view a few project resources Contributor: Everything Viewer can access plus view, modify, and access all project resources Owner: Everything Contributor has plus adding and removing team members, and deleting the project 4. Click Add team member:\nAfter adding a team member, you will be asked to create a profile for yourself.\n5. In the Create user profile form, enter the following values before clicking Create user profile:\nDisplay name: student Email address: student@cloudacademy.com You will see Logan and studentappear in the Team memberslist.\n6. Click Add team member and select Bessie from the drop-down menu.\n7. Enter the following values and click Add:\nEmail address: bessie@cloudacademy.com Project Role: Viewer Remote Access: Unchecked Now you can briefly experience the differences between the project roles.\n8. At the top of this Lab page, click on the Open Environment button.\nThis will sign you out of the student user and allow you to sign in as a different user.\n9. Log in to AWS using the team member in the viewer role:\nUser Name: Bessie Password: Lab-Viewer1 Navigate to AWS CodeStar in the AWS Console. 11. Click on your project name.\nObserve that the viewer role has access to view the same tabs as your student user.\n13. Click on the Repository \u003e Commit ID and see that a viewer is allowed to view code changes.\n14. Return to the project Pipeline section and click Release change, then Release.\nYou will receive an error message stating that you are not authorized to perform that action:\n15. At the top of this Lab page, click on the Open Environment button and sign in again with the following credentials:\nUser Name: Logan Password: Lab-Contributor1 The user Logan is in the contributor role, which has additional permissions than the viewer role.\n16. Click Release change, then Continue.\nThe contributor has permission to perform this action:\n17. Click Team in the left sidebar.\nNotice that you can only remove yourself from the team and not other members. That is a distinction between the contributor and owner roles.\n18. One last time, in the lab, click on the Open Environment button and sign in with the student credentials given in the Credentialssection of the Lab.\nCleaning Up Your AWS CodeStar Project 1.

The first node of the tree is called the root. If we visualize it, a tree data structure resembles an inverted tree, with the root at the top and the leaves (nodes without children) at the bottom.\nTrees are hierarchical, non-linear data structures.\nThey are excellent for representing relationships between objects, and their operations usually have a logarithmic time complexity, making them efficient for search operations.\nLet’s create a simple binary tree in Python, where each node can have at most two children:\nclass Node: def __init__(self, data): self.data = data self.left = None self.right = None root = Node(1) root.left = Node(2) root.right = Node(3) Here, we have a tree with the root node storing the value 1. The root node has two children: the left child stores the value 2, and the right child stores the value 3.\nTrie A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a type of tree that specializes in managing sequences, typically strings. In a trie, every node (except the root) corresponds to a character or a string, and each path down the tree can represent a word or a prefix.\nThe key characteristic of tries is that they provide a fast retrieval of data. They can check if a word or prefix exists in a dataset in O(M) time, where M is the length of the word.\nHere’s a simple Python example of a trie data structure:\nclass TrieNode: def __init__(self): self.children = {} self.end_of_string = False class Trie: def __init__(self): self.root = TrieNode() def insert(self, word): node = self.root for ch in word: if ch not in node.children: node.children[ch] = TrieNode() node = node.children[ch] node.end_of_string = True In this example, each node in the trie has a dictionary called children to keep references to its child nodes. The end_of_string flag helps determine if the current concatenation of characters forms a valid word.\nTries vs Trees Despite their shared properties (being tree-based structures), tries and trees are designed for different use cases.\nData Storage: A general-purpose tree can store any data type—numbers, strings, objects, whereas a trie is specifically used for storing sequences, like strings or arrays.\nNode Value: In a tree, each node holds a value. In a trie, nodes themselves don’t hold a value—instead, the value is the path from the root to that node.\nEfficiency: Tries are incredibly efficient when it comes to searching for a word or prefix in a dictionary. Trees, on the other hand, are more efficient for a wide range of operations, like searching, inserting, and deleting arbitrary values.\nMemory Usage: Tries can use more memory because of references in each node, especially when dealing with a large alphabet. Each node in a trie maintains a collection (often a dictionary or array) of all its child nodes. However, in a binary tree, each node only needs to keep a reference to at most two child nodes.\nLookup Time: Tries have a faster lookup time for certain tasks. For instance, finding a word in a trie takes O(M) time, where M is the length of the word. For a balanced binary search tree, the time complexity would be O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the tree.\n","description":"Difference between Tries and Trees?","title":"Difference between Tries and Trees?","uri":"/en/posts/tree-vs-trie-data-structures/"},{"content":" Docs EN | RU Posts EN | RU ","description":"","title":"Docs","uri":"/en/tracks/archive/"},{"content":"About AWS EC2 AWS EC2 User Guide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - one of the most popular AWS services.\nAllows:\nto run different types of cloud instances and pay-per-use models. to control computing resources at the operating system level working in an Amazon computing environment.

The application uses a username and password stored in the source code to connect to a MySQL database. The database will be migrated to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. As part of the migration, the company wants to implement a secure way to store and automatically rotate the database credentials.\nWhich approach meets these requirements?\nStore the database credentials in environment variables in an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Rotate the credentials by replacing the AMI. Store the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configure Parameter Store to automatically rotate the credentials. Store the database credentials in environment variables on the EC2 instances. Rotate the credentials by relaunching the EC2 instances. Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the credentials Explanation AWS Secrets Manager\nSecrets Manager offers secret rotation\n4\nQ2 An organization needs to provision a new Amazon EC2 instance with a persistent block storage volume to migrate data from its on-premises network to AWS. The required maximum performance for the storage volume is 64,000 IOPS.\nIn this scenario, which of the following can be used to fulfill this requirement?\nDirectly attach multiple Instance Store volumes in an EC2 instance to deliver maximum IOPS performance. Launch a Nitro-based EC2 instance and attach a Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume (io1) with 64,000 IOPS. Launch an Amazon EFS file system and mount it to a Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instance and set the performance mode to Max I/O. Launch any type of Amazon EC2 instance and attach a Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume (io1) with 64,000 IOPS. Explanation An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible.\nThe AWS Nitro System is the underlying platform for the latest generation of EC2 instances that enables AWS to innovate faster, further reduce the cost of the customers, and deliver added benefits like increased security and new instance types.\nAmazon EBS is a persistent block storage volume. It can persist independently from the life of an instance. Since the scenario requires you to have an EBS volume with up to 64,000 IOPS, you have to launch a Nitro-based EC2 instance.\nAmazon EBS volume types\n2\nQ3 A Database Specialist manages an EBS-Optimized Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Provisioned IOPS storage. The users recently raised a database IO latency issue during peak hours when it was always under a heavy workload. Upon review, the Specialist noticed that the RDS DB instance was barely using the maximum IOPS configured but was fully utilizing the maximum bandwidth for the required throughput. CloudWatch metrics showed that CPU and Memory utilization were at optimum levels.\nWhich action should the Database Specialist take to fix the performance issue?\nChange the underlying EBS storage type of the instance to General Purpose (SSD). Modify the DB instance to an EBS-Optimized instance class with higher maximum bandwidth. Disable EBS optimization on the MySQL DB instance to allow higher maximum bandwidth. Modify the DB instance to increase the size and corresponding Provisioned IOPS allocated to the storage. Explanation Amazon RDS volumes are built using Amazon EBS volumes, except for Amazon Aurora, which uses an SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. RDS currently supports both magnetic and SSD-based storage volume types. There are two supported Amazon EBS SSD-based storage types, Provisioned IOPS (called io1) and General Purpose (called gp2).\nProvisioned IOPS storage is a storage type that delivers predictable performance and consistently low latency. If your workload is I/O constrained, using Provisioned IOPS SSD storage can increase the number of I/O requests that the system can process concurrently.\nProvisioned IOPS SSD storage provides a way to reserve I/O capacity by specifying IOPS. However, as with any other system capacity attribute, its maximum throughput under load is constrained by the resource that is consumed first. That resource might be network bandwidth, CPU, memory, or database internal resources.\nEBS–optimized instances deliver dedicated bandwidth to Amazon EBS. When attached to an EBS–optimized instance, Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to achieve their provisioned performance, 99.9% of the time. Choose an EBS–optimized instance that provides more dedicated Amazon EBS throughput than your application needs; otherwise, the connection between Amazon EBS and Amazon EC2 can become a performance bottleneck.\n2\nQ4 A developer deployed an application to an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to know the public IPv4 address of the instance.\nHow can the application find this information?\nQuery the instance metadata from http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/. Query the instance user data from http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/. Query the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) information from http://169.254 169.254/latest/meta-data/ami/. Check the hosts file of the operating system. Explanation 1\nQ5 You are configuring a Jenkins project that is installed on an Amazon EC2 instance running a Windows operating system. You want this Jenkins project to integrate with AWS CodePipeline.\nWhich actions should you take to make this function perform correctly? (2 answers)\nRestart all Amazon EC2 instances that are running a Windows operating system. Provide the IAM user credentials to integrate AWS CodePipeline. Fill out the required fields for your proxy host. Modify the PATH variable to include the directory where you installed Jenkins on all Amazon EC2 instance that are running a Windows operating system.

All At Once means the application will be offline for the duration of the update. Performing a Rolling Update without an additional batch of servers means a reduction in capacity. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.deploy-existing-version.html For Blue green deployment - Use Elastic beanstalk swap URL feature or route 53 with weighted routing policies You create your own Elastic Beanstalk platform using Packer, which is an open-source tool for creating machine images for many platforms, including AMIs for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Price There is no additional charge for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Only the AWS resources required to store and run applications are charged.\nConcepts AWS doc Applications An application is a collection of different elements, such as environments, environment configurations, and application versions.\nYou can have multiple application versions held within an application.\nApplication Version An application version is a very specific reference to a section of deployable code. The application version will point typically to simple storage service (S3) where the deployable code may reside.\nEnvironment Configurations An environment configuration is a collection of parameters and settings that dictate how an environment will have its resources provisioned by Elastic Beanstalk and how these resources will behave.\nEnvironment An environment refers to an application version that has been deployed on AWS resources. These resources are configured and provisioned by AWS Elastic Beanstalk. At this stage the application is deployed as a solution and becomes operational within your environment.\nThe “environment” is comprised of ALL the resources created by Elastic Beanstalk and not just an EC2 instance with your uploaded code.\nEnvironment Tier Reflects on how Elastic Beanstalk provisions resources based on what the application is designed to do. If the application manages and handles HTTP requests, then the app will be run in a web server environment.\nConfiguration Template This is the template that provides the baseline for creating a new, unique, environment configuration.\nPlatform Culmination of components in which you can build your application upon using Elastic Beanstalk. These are comprised of the OS of the instance, the programming language, the server type (web or application), and components of Elastic Beanstalk\nDeployment policies All at once – deploys the new version to all instances simultaneously and will be out of service for a short time. Rolling – deploys the new version in batches. Rolling with additional batch – deploys the new version in batches, but first launch a new batch of instances. Immutable – deploys the new version to a new set of instances. Traffic splitting – deploys the new version to a new set of instances and temporarily split incoming client traffic.

You need to add and configure an Amazon ElastiCache cluster into the environment immediately after the application is deployed.\nWhat is the most efficient method to ensure that the cluster is deployed immediately after the EB application is deployed?\nUse the AWS Management Console to create and configure the cluster. Create a cron job to schedule the cluster deployment using the aws cloudformation deploy command Create a configuration file with the .config extension and place it into the .ebextensions folder in the application package. Build an AWS Lambda function that polls to the ElasticBeanstalk environment deployments and create and configure the Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Explanation [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-resources.html)\n3\nQ2 Emily is building a web application using AWS ElasticBeanstalk. The application uses static images like icons, buttons and logos. Emily is looking for a way to serve these static images in a performant way that will not disrupt user sessions.\nWhich of the following options would meet this requirement?\nUse an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume to serve the static image files. Configure the AWS ElasticBeanstalk proxy server to serve the static image files. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to serve the static image files. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume to serve the static image files. Explanation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-cfg-staticfiles.html\nAn Amazon S3 bucket would work, but the AWS ElasticBeanstalk proxy server would need to route the requests to the static files to a different place anytime they need to be shown.\n2\nQ3 An online shopping platform has been deployed to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk. They simply uploaded their Node.js application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Since the entire deployment process is automated, the DevOps team is not sure where to get the application log files of their shopping platform.\nIn Elastic Beanstalk, where does it store the application files and server log files?\nApplication files are stored in S3. The server log files can only be stored in the attached EBS volumes of the EC2 instances, which were launched by AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be stored directly in Glacier or in CloudWatch Logs. Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be optionally stored in CloudTrail or in CloudWatch Logs. Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs. Explanation AWS Elastic Beanstalk stores your application files and optionally, server log files in Amazon S3. If you are using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio, or AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, an Amazon S3 bucket will be created in your account and the files you upload will be automatically copied from your local client to Amazon S3.\nOptionally, you may configure Elastic Beanstalk to copy your server log files every hour to Amazon S3. You do this by editing the environment configuration settings.\nWith CloudWatch Logs, you can monitor and archive your Elastic Beanstalk application, system, and custom log files from Amazon EC2 instances of your environments. You can also configure alarms that make it easier for you to react to specific log stream events that your metric filters extract.\nThe CloudWatch Logs agent installed on each Amazon EC2 instance in your environment publishes metric data points to the CloudWatch service for each log group you configure.\nEach log group applies its own filter patterns to determine what log stream events to send to CloudWatch as data points. Log streams that belong to the same log group share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. You can configure Elastic Beanstalk to automatically stream logs to the CloudWatch service.\nThe option that says: Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be optionally stored in CloudTrail or in CloudWatch Logs is incorrect because the server log files can optionally be stored in either S3 or CloudWatch Logs, but not directly to CloudTrail as this service is primarily used for auditing API calls.\n4\nQ4 A former colleague reached out to you for consultation. He uploads a Django project in Elastic Beanstalk through CLI using instructions he read in a blog post, but for some reason he could not create the environment he needs for his project. He encounters an error message saying “The instance profile aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role associated with the environment does not exist.”\nWhat are the possible causes of this issue? (Select TWO.)\nHe selected the wrong platform for the Django code. Elastic Beanstalk CLI did not create one because your IAM role has no permission to create roles. Instance profile container for the role needs to be manually replaced every time a new environment is launched. You have not associated an Elastic Beanstalk role to your CLI. IAM role already exists but has insufficient permissions that Elastic Beanstalk needs.

No backups Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding) Memcached ElastiCache manages Memcached nodes as a pool that can grow and shrink (similar to an EC2 Auto Scaling group); individual nodes are expendable and non-persistent.\nMemcached provides a simple caching solution that best supports object caching and lets you scale out horizontally. Ideal for offloading a DB’s contents into a cache.\nRedis ElastiCache manages Redis more as a relational database, i.e. Redis clusters are managed as persistent, stateful entities that include using multi-AZ redundancy for handling failover (similar to RDS).\nRedis supports complex data structures, hence would be ideal in cases where sorting and ranking datasets in memory are important (e.g. such as in leaderboards for games).\nCaching Strategies Lazy Loading The data that is read from the DB is stored in the cache. The data can become stale The data becomes stale because there are no updates to the cache when data is changed in the database Only cache data when it is requested. Cache miss penalty on initial request. Chance to produce stale data; can be mitigated by setting a TTL. Shorter TTL = less stale data.\nWrite-Through The data is added/updated into the cache everytime the data is written to the DB (no stale data) Because the data in the cache is updated every time it’s written to the database, the data in the cache is always current. Every database write will write to the cache as well. Data is never stale however there will be alot more operations to perform; and these resources are wasted if most of the data is never used.\nSession Store Stores temporary session data in cache (with TTL) - Time to Live. Data expires after the given time Practice Configuring a Lambda function to access Amazon ElastiCache in an Amazon VPC\nQuestions Q1 What is one reason that AWS does not recommend that you configure your ElastiCache so that it can be accessed from outside AWS?\nThe metrics reported by CloudWatch are more difficult to report. Security concerns and network latency over the public internet. The ElastiCache cluster becomes more prone to failures. The performance of the ElastiCache cluster is no longer controllable. Explanation Elasticache is a service designed to be used internally to your VPC. External access is discouraged due to the latency of Internet traffic and security concerns. However, if external access to Elasticache is required for test or development purposes, it can be done through a VPN.\n2\nQ2 You are building a web application that will run in an AWS ElasticBeanstalk environment. You need to add and configure an Amazon ElastiCache cluster into the environment immediately after the application is deployed.\nWhat is the most efficient method to ensure that the cluster is deployed immediately after the EB application is deployed?\nUse the AWS Management Console to create and configure the cluster. Create a cron job to schedule the cluster deployment using the aws cloudformation deploy command Create a configuration file with the .config extension and place it into the .ebextensions folder in the application package. Build an AWS Lambda function that polls to the ElasticBeanstalk environment deployments and create and configure the Amazon ElastiCache cluster.

Here close prices is for example N: the period of the EMA. Multiplier: 2 / (N + 1) Previous EMA is the EMA of the previous period. The EMA for the first period is just the Close price.\nBut for subsequent periods, it’s calculated as follows:\nEMA = (Close - Previous EMA) * Multiplier + Previous EMA EMA[i] = (Close[i] - EMA[i-1]) * 2/(N+1) + EMA[i-1] However, the EMA’s calculation is slightly more complex for the initial period because there is no previous EMA. In this case, we use the SMA as the first EMA:\nEMA(first period) = SMA Example:\nLet’s calculate a 5-minute EMA at Minute 6 with the following market data:\nMinute Open High Low Close EMA 1 $10.0 $11.0 $9.5 $10.0 - 2 $10.1 $12.1 $10.0 $12.0 - 3 $12.2 $15.2 $12.0 $15.0 - 4 $15.1 $15.1 $13.9 $14.0 - 5 $14.1 $16.1 $14.0 $16.0 13.4(SMA) 6 $16.1 $16.1 $14.9 $15.0 15.67 7 $15.1 $17.1 $15.0 $17.0 … 8 $17.1 $17.1 $15.9 $16.0 … 9 $16.1 $18.1 $16.0 $18.0 … Can be calculated from first price\nHere, N = 5, so Multiplier = 2 / (5 + 1) = 0.33.\nSMA(5) = (10.0 + 12.0 + 15.0 + 14.0 + 16.0) / 5 = 13.4 This value becomes the first EMA (EMA[5]). Now, to calculate the EMA for the 6th minute, we use the EMA formula: EMA[6] = (Close[6] - EMA[5]) * multiplier + EMA[5] = (15.0 - 13.4) * 0.33 + 13.4 = 14.13 Pros and Cons Pros:\nMore responsive: By giving more weight to recent prices, the EMA can adapt faster to price changes. Combines trend and momentum: The EMA not only captures the overall trend but also shows the asset’s momentum. Often used for High frequency trading. Cons:\nMore prone to false signals: The sensitivity of the EMA can sometimes lead to false signals, especially in volatile markets. Complex calculation: Compared to the SMA, the EMA’s calculation is slightly more complex, especially for longer periods. Example of signals Like the SMA, traders often use two EMAs: a short-term one and a long-term one. When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, it’s a bullish (buy) signal, and when it crosses below, it’s a bearish (sell) signal.\nTrue Positive:\nIn minute 7, the short EMA crosses above the long EMA, which is a buy signal. The price then goes up, confirming this was a correct signal.\nIn a stable uptrend, the short-term EMA might cross above the long-term EMA, correctly suggesting that it’s a good time to enter a long position.\nFalse Positive:\nIn minute 11, the short EMA dips below the long EMA, suggesting a sell signal. However, the price increases in the next minute, making this a false signal.\nIn a volatile market, the price might swing up and down sharply, causing the short-term EMA to cross the long-term EMA back and forth, generating multiple buy and sell signals that could be misleading.\nUse in Real Trading In real trading, EMA can be used in combination with other indicators such as MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) or Bollinger Bands.\nFor instance, a trader might look for the short-term EMA to cross above the long-term EMA and the MACD to cross above its signal line as a confirmation for a long position.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"EMA Trading indicator","title":"EMA - Exponential Moving Average","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/ema/"},{"content":"Lab Encrypting S3 Objects Using SSE-KMS Creating a Customer Master Key (CMK) 1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter KMS, and click the KMS result under Services:\n2. Select Customer managed** keys** in the left pane of the KMS console.\nWarning: Cloud Academy cleans up the lab environment for you after a lab is completed or terminated. As a precaution, AWS prevents keys from being deleted immediately. Rather, they are queued for deletion, and an expiration period is set (of 7-30 days). For this reason, you may see residual keys from other students within the last week. For this reason, you may need to append a unique number to the Alias field in the next instruction.\n3. Click Create Key, then expand Advanced Optionsand set the following values:\nKey type: Symmetric(Symmetric keys are suitable for most data encryption applications. The same key is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations with symmetric key algorithms.) Key usage: Encrypt and decrypt Advanced options: Key Material Origin: Leave as KMS (default). AWS will generate the key material for encryption. Note that another common use case is for customers to generate their own keys, and have AWS keep a back up encrypted copy and help manage them with KMS. Regionality:Single-Region key 4. Click Next to advance to the Add Labels page of the wizard.\n5. Set the following values before clicking Next (leave the default values for other fields)\nAlias: calabs-CMK-key(Append a unique number to the key’s Alias if needed to be unique. For example, calabs-CMK-key2.) Description: 6. Click Next to advance to Define Key Administrative Permissions and leave the default values.\nAdministrative permissions allow users and roles to administer CMKs but not to perform cryptographic operations. In production environments, this is sometimes used to easily grant limited access to other users. The Allow key administrators to delete this keycheckbox makes it explicit if deleting keys is allowed, since the key can’t be recovered once deleted, making recovery of encrypted data impossible. Note that key deletion is not immediate and first enters into a pending state before the key is deleted. The delete operation can be canceled while in the pending state.\nThese settings generate a key policy. The default policy allows IAM policies to grant access the key, which is why you don’t require selecting your student user as an administrator. The lab IAM policy of your student user allows you to perform the required actions of the lab.\n7. Click Next to advance to Define Key Usage Permissions.\nUsage permissions grant access to perform cryptographic operations such as encrypting and decrypting. Enterprises usually have different permissions for administrators and users, hence the wizard walks you through defining both.\nNotice that you can grant access to the key so other AWS accounts can use it for encryption/decryption.\n8. Click Nextto preview the key policy and then click Finish when ready. The CMK is created.\n9.

In the S3 bucket console, click the Permissions tab followed by Bucket Policy to open the Bucket policy editor:\nBucket policies are IAM policies applied to a bucket rather than to a user or role as is conventionally done with IAM policies. Similar to how a key policy applied to the CMK. These are examples of resource-based policies in AWS.\n2. Paste the following bucket policy into the policy editor:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Id\": \"RequireSSEKMS\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"DenyUploadIfNotSSEKMSEncrypted\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::\u003cYour_Bucket_Name\u003e/*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringNotEquals\": { \"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption\": \"aws:kms\" } } } ] } This policy denies (\"Effect\": \"Deny\") all users’ (\"Principal\": \"*\") uploads (\"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\") to the bucket (\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::\u003cYour_Bucket_Name\u003e/*\") if the s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption is not set to aws:kms, which corresponds to SSE-KMS. The lab provides you with the policy but you could recreate it using the policy generator linked to beneath the policy editor.\n3. Replace \u003cYour_Bucket_Name\u003e with the name of your lab bucket (it begins with cloudacademylabs-ssekms- and can be copied from the S3 console):\n4. Click Save changes to save the policy and have it start being enforced.\n5. Click the Objectstab followed by Upload.\n6. Click Add files and select a small file, or download this sample file and select it.\n7. Click Upload and observe the image does not appear in the bucket contents table.\nClicking upload without configuring any properties of the object uses the default of no encryption.\nYou can see the upload Failed.\n8. Retry the upload but this time use the Set properties step to configure Encryptionto AWS KMS master-key using your CMK.\nThe upload now succeeds since the bucket policy condition is satisfied:\nThe policy does not require the use of your CMK however, so the default S3 KMS key in the region is also allowed.

An ARN is used to uniquely identify resources in AWS.\nIn this lab, the EC2 instance has been configured with an IAM role that has permissions to interact with Amazon SNS topics and Amazon SQS queues.\nStore the value of the TopicArn attribute in a shell variable (topic_arn): topic_arn=$(aws sns list-topics --query 'Topics[0].TopicArn' --output text) The above command uses the --query option to select only the value of the TopicArn and the --output option is used to specify plaintext format which removes the quotation marks from the value.\nTo publish a message, enter the following, utilizing the ARN you stored in the topic_arn shell variable: aws sns publish \\ --topic-arn $topic_arn \\ --message \"1 x Widget @ 21.99 USD\\n2 x Widget Cables @ 5.99 USD\" In response, you will see a MessageId:\nNote: Your message identifier will be different.\nYou have successfully published an order message to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic.\nIn this lab, you are using the AWS command-line interface tool to simulate an application publishing an order message.\nIn a non-lab environment, the message could be published by a web application that accepts orders from customers.\nTo list Amazon Simple Queue Service queues, enter the following command: aws sqs list-queues You will see a JSON response:\nThe queues that you created earlier are listed.\nStore each of the QueueUrls in shell variables: analytics_queue_url=$(aws sqs list-queues --query 'QueueUrls[0]' --output text) inventory_queue_url=$(aws sqs list-queues --query 'QueueUrls[1]' --output text) To retrieve a message from the orders-for-analytics queue, enter the following command, utilizing the analytics queue URL you stored previously: aws sqs receive-message \\ --queue-url $analytics_queue_url You will see a JSON response containing an array with one Message:\nThe response contains the following fields:\nBody: A JSON representation of the message ReceiptHandle: You are required to supply this to delete a message after processing MD5OfBody: An MD5 hash of the message body MessageId: The message identifier that Amazon SNS saw when pushing the message to the queues Note that this is not the same as the MessageId that Amazon SNS returned to you when you published to the topic Repeat the previous instruction, using the orders-for-inventory queue but store the message response in a shell variable (for use later) and output the shell variable (using Python’s JSON tool to pretty print it): inventory_message=$(aws sqs receive-message --queue-url $inventory_queue_url) echo $inventory_message | python -m json.tool You will see the same message displayed again.\nThe message you published to the Amazon SNS topic has been sent to the Amazon SQS queues you subscribed the topic. This is an example of fanning out a message to multiple receivers.\nIn a non-lab environment, you could have worker applications constantly running and asking the Amazon SQS queues for more messages. One worker may be updating an inventory database for the order, whilst another worker could be recording the order details in a data lake for future analysis.\nUsing Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS like this allows you to build scalable systems that are decoupled and resilient. If a worker went offline, messages would queue up in the Amazon SQS queues. When the worker is available again, it can pick up new messages where it left off.\nYou can also have multiple worker applications, to help ensure there’s no downtime in message processing.\nAfter successfully processing a message, a worker application should delete the message to prevent it from being processed again.\nStore the value of the ReceiptHandle attribute in a shell variable: receipt_handle=$(echo $inventory_message | python -m json.tool | grep ReceiptHandle | cut -d\\\" -f 4) To delete a message, enter the following command for the orders-for-inventory queue: aws sqs delete-message \\ --queue-url $inventory_queue_url \\ --receipt-handle $receipt_handle Return to your browser tab with the Amazon SQS management console open. Note: If the SQS management console appears to only have one SQS queue, click the refresh button above the table:\nThe correct number of SQS queues will be displayed after a refresh.\nNavigate to the Queues list and click the orders-for-inventory queue.\nIn the top-right, click Send and receive messages:\nVerify that in that Receive messages section, under Messages available, it says 0. This is the queue you deleted a message for, simulating a long-running background application that receives an Amazon SQS message and then deletes the message after processing.\nRepeat the last three instructions for the orders-for-analytics queue and verify Messages available is 1: This is the queue you did not delete the message for. The message is still available to be picked up for processing by an application receiving messages from the queue.\n","description":"Fan-Out Orders using Amazon SNS and SQS","title":"Fan-Out Orders using Amazon SNS and SQS","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/sqs/fan-out-orders-with-sns-sqs/"},{"content":"About Serverless version of ECS.\nServerless compute for contai­ners.\nAWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers.\nDeploy and manage your applications, not infrastructure.

Technically, Amazon S3 is an object-store. It is not a block storage device and does not contain a file system as your local computer does. However, files such as images, movies, and sound clips are often uploaded from your file system to Amazon S3.\nInstructions 1. Click on the object you just uploaded to the S3 bucket.\nTake a look at the Object overview section:\nUnder Object URL, right-click the link and open the URL in a new browser tab: You will see an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) response telling you that access is denied for this object:\nNote: The response may appear differently depending upon your web browser.\nLeave the browser tab open.

Python, with its strong set of libraries, has emerged as a go-to language for data visualization. In this tutorial, we will create an application that generates and displays interactive financial charts using Tkinter and Plotly.\nPrerequisites Before we get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:\nPython 3.6 or newer Dash, Plotly’s Python framework for building analytical web applications. Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI package. You can install Dash using pip:\npip install dash plotly Step 1: Python Script Imports import tkinter as tk import threading import webbrowser import random import plotly.graph_objs as go import dash_html_components as html from dash import Dash, dcc from dash.dependencies import Output, Input Step 2: Creating a Dash Application Thread We’ll be running the Dash application in a separate thread. This allows the Tkinter GUI and Dash app to run simultaneously. To do this, we create a new DashThread class that inherits from Python’s threading.Thread:\nclass DashThread(threading.Thread): def __init__(self, data_list): threading.Thread.__init__(self) self.data_list = data_list self.app = Dash(__name__) # Initialize an empty graph self.app.layout = html.Div( [ dcc.Graph(id=\"live-graph\", animate=True), dcc.Interval( id=\"graph-update\", interval=1 * 1000, ), ] ) @self.app.callback( Output(\"live-graph\", \"figure\"), [Input(\"graph-update\", \"n_intervals\")] ) def update_graph(n): data = [ go.Scatter( x=list(range(len(self.data_list[symbol]))), y=self.data_list[symbol], mode=\"lines+markers\", name=symbol, ) for symbol in self.data_list.keys() ] fig = go.Figure(data=data) # Update x-axis range to show last 120 data points fig.update_xaxes(range=[max(0, n - 120), n]) return fig def run(self): self.app.run_server(debug=False) Step 3: Creating the Main Application Class The App class will initialize the Tkinter window and generate random prices for each of the financial symbols:\nclass App: def __init__(self, root): self.root = root self.data_list = {\"ETHUSDT\": [], \"BTCUSD\": [], \"BNBUSDT\": []} # Start the Dash application in a separate thread dash_thread = DashThread(self.data_list) dash_thread.start() # Open Dash app in web browser webbrowser.open(\"http://localhost:8050\") # Start the price generation in tkinter after Dash app is launched self.root.after(1000, self.generate_prices) def generate_prices(self): for symbol in self.data_list.keys(): new_price = random.randint(1, 100) # Generate random price self.data_list[symbol].append(new_price) # Store the price in list # Schedule the function to run again after 1 second self.root.after(1000, self.generate_prices) Step 4: Running the Application Finally, we create a Tkinter root window, instantiate the App class, and start the Tkinter event loop:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\": root = tk.Tk() app = App(root) root.mainloop() Conclusion You’ve successfully created an application that generates and displays interactive financial charts using Tkinter and Plotly. This project can be extended with real-time data feeds and additional interactive features to fit your needs.

It doesn’t apply to any specific region. There is no charge to use IAM. IAM is compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) The “root account” has complete Admin access. Don’t use “root account” for everyday use. Instead, create users. A new user will have NO permissions by default. Grant least privilege needed for their job. New user will be assigned with password, Access Key ID \u0026 Secret Access Keys. The password will be used to login to AWS management console. Access Key ID \u0026 Secret Access Key will be used to login via the APIs and CLI Always setup MFA on your root account. Use Groups to assign permissions to IAM users Use Roles to Delegate permissions. Role is more secure than creating individual user. Roles gives temporary credentials for access; whereas User has long term credentials. Create and customize password rotation policies Policies can be attached to users, groups and roles. Use AWS defined policies, assign permissions wherever possible. Policy is defined in JSON format and contains version, statements, - effect, action, resource, principal, and condition. STS Security Token Service provides temporary security credentials to the trusted users. STS is global and there is no charge to use it.

We will use it in the next step Logging in as a new user Checking privileges This user has access to view EC2 instances. Let’s check whether or not the S3 garbage cans have access.\nLet’s try to create an S3 bucket After trying to create a recycle bucket, we get a window indicating no permissions Questions Q1 A client has contracted you to review their existing AWS environment and recommend and implement best practice changes. You begin by reviewing existing users and Identity Access Management. You found out improvements that can be made with the use of the root account and Identity Access Management.\nWhat are the best practice guidelines for use of the root account?\nNever use the root account. Use the root account only to create administrator accounts. Use the root account to create your first IAM user and then lock away the root account. Use the root account to create all other accounts, and share the root account with one backup administrator. Explanation lock-away-credentials 1\nQ2 Your organization has an AWS setup and planning to build Single Sign-On for users to authenticate with on-premise Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and let users log in to the AWS console using AWS STS Enterprise Identity Federation.\nWhich of the following services do you need to call from AWS STS service after you authenticate with your on-premise?\nAssumeRoleWithSAML GetFederationToken AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity GetCallerIdentity Explanation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html 1\nQ3 Alice is building a mobile application. She planned to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when accessing some AWS resources.\nWhich of the following APIs will be leveraged to provide temporary security credentials?\nAssumeRoleWithSAML GetFederationToken GetSessionToken AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity Explanation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html\nAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity - does not support MFA\n3\nQ4 A leading insurance firm has several new members in its development team. The solutions architect was instructed to provision access to certain IAM users who perform application development tasks in the VPC.\nThe access should allow the users to create and configure various AWS resources, such as deploying Windows EC2 servers. In addition, the users should be able to see the permissions in AWS Organizations to view information about the user’s organization, including the master account email and organization limitations.\nWhich of the following should the solutions architect implement to follow the standard security advice of granting the least privilege?\nAttach the PowerUserAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM users. Attach the AdministratorAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM users. Create a new IAM role and attach the SystemAdministrator AWS managed policy to it. Assign the IAM Role to the IAM users. Create a new IAM role and attach the AdministratorAccess AWS managed policy to it. Assign the IAM Role to the IAM users. Explanation AWS managed policies for job functions are designed to closely align to common job functions in the IT industry. You can use these policies to easily grant the permissions needed to carry out the tasks expected of someone in a specific job function.\nThese policies consolidate permissions for many services into a single policy that’s easier to work with than having permissions scattered across many policies.\nFor Developer Power Users, you can use the AWS managed policy name: PowerUserAccess if you have users who perform application development tasks. This policy will enable them to create and configure resources and services that support AWS aware application development.\nThe first statement of this policy uses the NotAction element to allow all actions for all AWS services and for all resources except AWS Identity and Access Management and AWS Organizations. The second statement grants IAM permissions to create a service-linked role.\nThis is required by some services that must access resources in another service, such as an Amazon S3 bucket. It also grants Organizations permissions to view information about the user’s organization, including the master account email and organization limitations.\n1\nQ5 A company has 100 AWS accounts that are consolidated using AWS Organizations. The accountants from the finance department log in as IAM users in the TD-Finance AWS account. The finance team members need to read the consolidated billing information in the TD-Master AWS master account that pays the charges of all the member (linked) accounts. The required IAM access to the AWS billing services has already been provisioned in the master account.\nThe Security Officer should ensure that the finance team must not be able to view any other resources in the master account.\nWhich of the following grants the finance team the necessary permissions for the above requirement?\nSet up an IAM group for the finance users in the TD-Finance account then attach a ViewBilling permission and AWS managed ReadOnlyAccess IAM policy to the group. Set up individual IAM users for the finance users in the TD-Master account then attach the AWS managed ReadOnlyAccess IAM policy to the group with cross-account access. Set up an AWS IAM role in the TD-Finance account with the ViewBilling permission then grant the finance users in the TD-Master account the permission to assume that role. Set up an IAM role in the TD-Master account with the ViewBilling permission then grant the finance users in the TD-Finance account the permission to assume the role. Explanation You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate billing and payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL) accounts. Every organization in AWS Organizations has a master (payer) account that pays the charges of all the member (linked) accounts.\nModifyAccount – Allow or deny IAM users permission to modify Account Settings. ModifyAccount – Allow or deny IAM users permission to modify Account Settings. ModifyBilling – Allow or deny IAM users permission to modify billing settings. ModifyPaymentMethods – Allow or deny IAM users permission to modify payment methods. ViewAccount – Allow or deny IAM users permission to view account settings. ViewBilling – Allow or deny IAM users permission to view billing pages in the console. ViewPaymentMethods – Allow or deny IAM users permission to view payment methods. ViewUsage – Allow or deny IAM users permission to view AWS usage reports. Use policies to grant permissions to perform an operation in AWS. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation.\n4\nResources Security best practices in IAM IAM Hands-On Lab IAM Workshops Security workshop tutorialsdojo digest Community posts https://dev.to/romankurnovskii/aws-iam-cheet-sheet-3if4 ","description":"A step-by-step guide to setting up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)","title":"IAM","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/iam/"},{"content":" My image float right, tall Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Both of these referenced configurations are defined elsewhere in the template.\nThe UserData script defined next performs the following tasks once the EC2 instance is created:\nUpdates the aws-cfn-bootstrappackage to retrieve the latest version of the helper scripts Runs the cfn-init helper script to execute the WebServer instance Metadata scripts Runs the cfn-signalhelper script to notify CloudFormation after all the service(s) (Apache in this case) is installed and configured on the EC2 instance Note: The cfn-init helper script is not executed automatically. You must run the cfn-init script within the EC2 instance UserData in order to execute your metadata scripts.\nThe cfn-signal helper script works hand-in-hand with the CreationPolicy configuration. The ResourceSignal property has a Count of 1 and a Timeout of PT5M. This instructs CloudFormation to wait for up to 5 minutes to receive 1 resource signal from the EC2 instance.\nThe cfn-signal helper script call in the UserData uses $? to retrieve the return code of the previous script. If the cfn-init script is successful and the EC2 instance is configured properly, cfn-signal returns a success to CloudFormation which then transitions the EC2 instance to the CREATE_COMPLETEstatus. If the cfn-init script is unsuccessful or the timeout of 5 minutes expires before receiving a signal, then the EC2 instance will be transitioned to a CREATE_FAILEDstatus and the stack deployment will fail.\nThe EC2 instance Metadata configuration is the same as the previous lab step. It defines a AWS::CloudFormation::Init script to install the httpd package using yum, generate an index.html file within /var/www/html/ and start the httpd service to serve the content from the EC2 instance.\n5.

These distinctions stem from how these user accounts interact (or don’t interact) with the system.\nDefinition Interactive Users: These are users who interact directly with the system, usually through a shell. When you log into a computer using SSH or a terminal, you’re operating as an interactive user. Non-Interactive Users: These users are designed to perform specific tasks without direct human intervention. Examples include system accounts running services like apache or mysql. Interaction, Usage, Environment Interaction:\nInteractive: Engages with the system via interfaces like shells. Non-Interactive: Executes tasks automatically, often without a shell or user interface. Usage:\nInteractive: Utilized for general-purpose tasks, from browsing directories to installing software. Non-Interactive: Specific to particular duties, often system-related. Environment:\nInteractive: Has a full user environment. This includes a HOME directory, user-specific settings, etc. Non-Interactive: Limited or no user environment. Typically lacks things like a HOME directory. Creating user When creating users in Linux, there’s often no distinction between interactive and non-interactive users. The difference arises in how the user is utilized. However, for security and operational reasons, non-interactive users might have restricted shells or no shell at all.\nWhy Not Simply Create a User and Use It Non-Interactively?\nEven if a user is created as interactive, it can be used non-interactively.

AWS has done an excellent job defining CloudWatch key concepts. Read the abbreviated excerpt from their official documentation below to obtain an understanding of Metrics, Namespaces and Alarms:\nMetrics\nA metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch and represents a time-ordered set of data points. These data points can be either your custom metrics or metrics from other services in AWS. You or AWS products publish metric data points into CloudWatch and you retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data. Metrics exist only in the region in which they are created.\nThink of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points represent the values of that variable over time. For example, the CPU usage of a particular Amazon EC2 instance is one metric, and the latency of an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer is another.\nNamespaces\nCloudWatch namespaces are containers for metrics. Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other, so that metrics from different applications are not mistakenly aggregated into the same statistics.\nNote: In this lab you will see namespaces that AWS has created for you, and a custom namespace created by the steps performed in this lab.\nAlarms\nYou can use an alarm to automatically initiate actions on your behalf. An alarm watches a single metric over a specified time period, and performs one or more specified actions, based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over time. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or an Auto Scaling policy. You can also add alarms to dashboards.\nAlarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only. CloudWatch alarms will not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state. The state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods.\nThe interested student can take a look at the full version of the documentation here. Due to time constraints, you should look at additional documentation once you have completed the lab.\n2. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter CloudWatch, and click the CloudWatch result under Services:\n3. Click Metrics \u003e All metrics in the left navigation pane. At this point, there are most likely no custom namespaces. But several AWS namespaces may already be established for you. What metrics are listed on the All metricstab depends on a couple of factors:\nHow quickly you arrived at this view after starting your lab. This lab creates an EC2 instance and EBS volume when you start the lab. After a couple of minutes of delay, metrics for the EC2 and EBS namespaces are included. How recently your Cloud Academy AWS account has been used to complete other Cloud Academy labs. If the AWS account you logged in to recently completed other labs, you may see namespace related to metrics collected in those labs. 4. Spend a few minutes to explore what metrics and namespaces look like in the CloudWatch console. Simply select any namespace and then any particular metric. As an example, the EC2 namespace and CPUUtilizationmetric for the HighCPUInstance are selected in the image below:\nNote: The image above is for illustrative purposes only, you do not need to choose the same instance or metric to explore CloudWatch metrics.\nThe longer the instance has been running, the more data points will appear in the graph. By default, EC2 metrics are collected every five minutes. You may need to adjust the displayed timeline to 1 week (1w) or further in the past to see some metrics.\nMonitoring EC2 Instances 1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter EC2, and click the EC2 result under Services:\n2. Click Instancesfrom the navigation pane and select the box near the instance name. A wealth of instance information is displayed in the Details tab:\nWhen you started the Lab, Cloud Academy configured the lab environment for you. This includes a medium instance named HighCPUInstance.\nNote: Your information will vary. There is additional instance information not shown in the example above.\n3. Switch to the Monitoring tab and take a look at the standard metrics:\nNote: If you don’t see an instance yet, it’s possible that it’s still provisioning in the background. Refresh the page every minute or so until it appears.\nThese are the standard metrics that CloudWatch monitors for all your EC2 instances. Please refer to the documentation for details. (Due to possible time constraints, please look up additional information in the documentation after completing this lab.)\nYou should be aware that all the metrics in this tab related to Disk (Disk Reads, Disk Read Operations, Disk Writes, Disk Write Operations) pertain to ephemeral storage disks. Those metrics will not represent anything if you have launched an EBS backed instance. To see the metrics related to EBS volumes you need to look elsewhere. Next you will take a look at the metrics of the EBS volume for this particular instance.\nNote: Ephemeral storage is also known as instance storage. It is temporary storage that is added to your instance, unlike EBS which is an attached volume that is permanent in nature.\n4. To enable and disable detailed monitoring, click Manage detailed monitoring:\nThe Detailed monitoring page will open :\nHere you can enable and disable detailed monitoring by checking or unchecking the Enable checkbox followed by clicking Save.\n5. Click Cancel as we will not be enabling detailed monitoring in this lab:\n6. Reselect the HighCPUInstance , click the Storage tab. Scroll down and click on the Volume Id (lower right):\n7. Select the volume and click on the Monitoring tab to see the metrics for this EBS volume:\nAs you can see, Amazon does quite a bit out of the box with respect to monitoring EC2 Instances and EBS volumes. However, you can enable Detailed Monitoring for even more control over the monitoring frequency of EC2 instances. CloudWatch monitors EC2 instances every 5 minutes by default. If you need more frequent monitoring, you can enable CloudWatch’s Detailed Monitoring feature to monitor your instances every minute. You can enable Detailed Monitoring during the instance launch or change it anytime afterwards. Note: Detailed Monitoring does come with an associated cost.\nInstall the EC2 Monitoring Scripts 1. Navigate to EC2 Instances by clicking here.\n2. Click on Launch instances:\n3. In the Application and OS Images section, select the Amazon Linux option under Quick Start:\n4. In the Instance Type section, you should not change any options. Simply make sure the default t2.microis selected:\n5. In the Key pair section, select the keypair:\nNote: Your keypair may differ from the screenshot. Reminder: The PEM or PPK formatted key pair can be downloaded directly from the Your lab data section of the Cloud Academy Lab page at any time.\n6. Scroll down and expand the Advanced details section. Under IAM instance profile, select the IAM role provided. It will have a name that looks similar to cloudacademylabs-EC2MonitoringRole-XXXXXXXXXX :\n7. Scroll down to Detailed CloudWatch monitoring and select Enable:\n8. Scroll down to User data and copy and paste the following bash script code in the User data (As text) field:\nThis is where the magic happens. Next you will insert the code to execute during the instance launch. However, in order to send metrics to CloudWatch, you need to configure some credentials first. You can use either Access Keys or IAM roles for this task. In this Lab, you will follow the best practices and use IAM roles. There is an instance role already created in you account configured with the proper permissions.\nCopy code\n!/bin/bash yum install -y perl-Switch perl-DateTime perl-Sys-Syslog perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-Digest-SHA.x86_64 wget http://aws-cloudwatch.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip unzip CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip rm CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip echo “/1 ** * /aws-scripts-mon/mon-put-instance-data.pl –mem-util –disk-space-util –disk-path=/ –from-cron” \u003e monitoring.txt crontab monitoring.txt rm monitoring.txt\nThis bash script will get executed the first time the instances launches. In summary, the script will:\nInstall Perl libraries Retrieve and install the AWS CloudWatch Monitoring scripts Configure crontab to run the monitoring script every minute 9. In the Summary section, click Launch instance:\nA confirmation page will let you know that your instance is launching:\n10. Click View all instances.\nNotice the Name for the new instance is blank by default. Although not mandatory, it is helpful to have a name. Move your mouse into the blank space in the Name column. It turns to an edit pencil. Use the pencil to change your Instance Name to Monitoring Scripts:\nWait until theInstance State is R****unningfor the new Instance. It typically takes less than one minute for the state to transition fromP****ending to R****unning.\n11. Navigate back to CloudWatch by clicking hereand clickAll metricsfrom the navigation pane. Notice that there is a new namespace called System/LinuxunderCustom namespaces:\nThis name is configured when you send the custom metrics.\nNote: If you don’t see the new Namespace wait a few minutes and refresh the page. CloudWatch takes some time to display the information in the dashboard. Recall that the newly installed monitoring scripts send data every minute based on the crontab configuration setup in the User data bash script for the instance.\n12. Click on the new System/Linux namespace:\nThere are two metrics being monitored by CloudWatch in the custom System/Linux namespace. (Filesystem, InstanceId, MountPath and InstanceId)\n13. Click the metric on the left (Filesystem…), then select the checkbox so the first metric is graphed.\n14. Click Linux System, so the Metrics path is All \u003e Linux System again. Now select the metric on the right (InstanceId) and select its checkbox as well.\n15. Switch to the Graphed metrics tab. If you selected both metrics correctly the tab will include a “(2)” at the end of it indicating how many metrics are graphed. Your graph should look similar to the following:\nIt is simple to customize the display to meet your needs for the metrics displayed.\n16. Click the custom graph period drop-down above the graph display area and select 15from the Minutesrow:\n17. Select the Period drop-down column menu for each metric in the lower Graphed metrics tab and choose 1 Minute:\nYou can now see the highest resolution metrics that are being sent to CloudWatch every minute. (You may need to refresh the chart after setting the new periods)\n18. Select Maximum for the Statisticcolumn. Instead of an average of the datapoints, the maximum will be graphed. (Note: In the lab example it is probably the same since the disk really has not been touched) Your configuration should look like:\nCreating Your First CloudWatch Alarm 1. Navigate to CloudWatch by clicking here, click on Alarms\u003eAll Alarms in the left pane:\nThere are no Alarms configured, so there are no records found. Further, the three types of Alarms are all at zero (0).\nNote: More information on Alarm states will be covered soon.\n2. Click Create Alarm and click Select metric. Select the EC2 namespace:\nMany different metrics are displayed for both the HighCPUInstance and the Monitoring Scripts instances.\n3. Click Per-instance metrics, scroll down and select the metric with HighCPUInstanceunder Instance NameandCPUUtilizationunder Metric Name:\nTip: You may need to use the arrows in the upper right to find the HighCPUInstance on another page. Alternatively, you can make note of the last 3 or 4 characters in the InstanceId from the EC2 console, then enter those in the Search Metrics field. The search applies to all pages of information.\nOnce selected it is graphed immediately. Notice that you could tailor the graph to a specific Time Range (upper-right). For example, the time range can be specified in Relative or Absolute terms.\n4. Click Select metric when ready.\n5. Under Conditions, set the following values leaving the defaults for the rest:\n_Whenever High CPU is…:_Greater/Equal Than…: 50 An alarm watches for a metric to go beyond an allowable value range when monitored over time. If violated the alarm’s state is changed. There are three possibles states for an alarm:\nOK—The metric is within the defined threshold\nIn alarm—The metric is outside of the defined threshold\nInsufficient data—The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state\n6. Click Nextand fill out the form as described:\nAlarm state trigger: In alarm **Select an SNS topic:**Create new topic Insert a valid e-mail and click on Create topic.\n7. Click Next and fill the form as described before clicking Next:\nDefine a unique name: High CPU Alarm description: When CPU utilization \u003e= 50% Tip: Be sure to use your valid email address in the Email list field so you can verify the Alarm later. AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) is used to send the email when the alarm is triggered. However, you will not need to configure anything in SNS.\n8. Click Create alarm when ready.\n9. Check for an email from AWS Notifications. Open up the email and click the Confirm subscription link:\nYou should receive a subscription confirmation. (For example, a confirmation message from Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) in a new browser tab if using a browser-based email client like Gmail.) To summarize, you have created a new alarm, along with a new SNS topic. Since you subscribed to this new SNS topic, every time the state of the alarm switches to ALARM you will receive an email. You may not receive an alarm email if the time it took to confirm the SNS topic subscription took longer than the time it took for the alarm to trigger. Emails will only be sent to subscribers at the time of the alarm transition.\n10. You should be put to the Alarm page:\nNote your Alarm state may differ. For example, you may be in an Insufficient datastate briefly and then transition either to In alarm or OK.\nTroubleshooting Tip: If the state of your alarm does not change to In alarm almost immediately, it is probably because you picked the incorrect instance. The HighCPUInstance is designed to trigger an alarm due to a high CPU utilization metric. The Monitoring Scripts instance is not taxed at all. To remedy the situation you can either create a new alarm with the correct instance, lower the threshold to something artificially low (1), or change the \u003e= to \u003c= (which is not very realistic but will test the alarm).\n11. Click the Alarm. You can see very useful information about the alarm itself. In the Details tab, there is a general overview of the alarm, and in the History tab you can see up to the last 50 states of the alarm:\n12. After an In alarmstate is raised, check for an email titled ALARM: “High CPU Alarm” in US West - Oregon from AWS Notifications.\nAgain, you may not have received an email because the alarm triggers before you had time to subscribe to the notification topic. Don’t worry, in the next Lab Step, you will reuse the topic for another alarm. Because you are already subscribed, you will receive an email. You could also retrigger the alarm by editing the alarm to trigger when CPUUtilization is \u003e= 500 (which can never happen for the single CPU instance). Wait five minutes until the alarm is disabled, then edit the alarm to trigger when CPUUtilization \u003e= 50.\n13. Now move to the History tab:\nYour History is likely similar to the example shown above. The oldest event is the furthest down. In succession, the Alarm was created; the state changed from INSUFFICIENT DATA to ALARM; SNS sent off an email notification.\n15. Spend a few minutes exploring the latest alarm history and try to understand what is going on with each entry. You can see more details for each entry by clicking the date.\nCreate an Alarm using the EC2 console 1. Navigate to EC2 Instances by clicking here.\n2. Select the Monitoring Scripts instance, then switch to the Status Checks tab:\n3. Click Actions\u003e Create Status Check Alarm:\nThis dialog is similar in function to the create alarm wizard you saw in an earlier Lab Step.\n4. For the Alarm notification, select the SNS topic name you set up before.\nOther fields can be kept at their defaults. The Alarm thresholds section uses Status check failed: either to trigger the alarm for either instance or system status check failures:\n5. Click Create when ready. An alarm creation confirmation message is displayed:\nNow you know two different ways to create alarms: one from CloudWatch and the other from the EC2 console. Next, you will learn how to attach EC2 actions to alarms.\n6. Return to the**Alarms by clicking here.**Notice that the first alarm you created is stuck in the In alarm state.\nThe alarm is stuck in the In alarm state because the instance is running an application that consumes 100% of the CPU utilization. Clearly an indicator that something may have gone wrong with the instance. Imagine that you are managing a production environment and you have an instance that is becoming unavailable intermittently because of high CPU utilization. You would like to receive a notification every time the CPU utilization is high, but this can happen anytime, in the middle of the night, or during a weekend or holiday. It would be helpful to have a pre-defined action in this case – at least until you find a definitive solution for the problem.\nTo help you address the scenario, you can set EC2 actions on your alarms.\n8. Select the High CPU alarm and then Actions \u003e Edit:\nTo make your alarm more suitable to the training environment needs, set a new EC2 Action to Reboot this instance whenever the state of this alarm is ALARM.\n9. Click on Next and click on Add EC2 actionunder EC2 action. Select Reboot this instance.\n10. Click Update alarm when ready.\nAlthough the changes have been made to the alarm, the alarm remains in the In alarm state. CloudWatch will only perform actions when the state transitions to the In alarmstate from another state. In the next instruction, you will modify the alarm to quickly have it change to the OKstate and then change it back to return to the In alarmstate.\n11. Select the High CPUAlarm and choose Actions \u003e Edit. Toggle the relationship from \u003e= to \u003c= and click Update alarm:\n12. Refresh the page to ensure the alarm has transitioned to the OKstate. Then toggle the condition back to \u003e= and save the alarm to have it transition to the In alarm state.\n_Note:_The state change may not be immediate and may take up to 2 minutes.\n13. Navigate back to the Instances by clicking here and watch CloudWatch reboot the instance when the Alarm Status changes to In alarm.\nIn case you miss it, you can return to the alarm in CloudWatch and see the Reboot Action listed in the Historysection:\n14. Check your email client and confirm that you received a notification of the alarm:\nSharing CloudWatch Metrics with others 1. Go to CloudWatch by clicking here and click on Metrics\u003e All metrics.\n2. Select an interesting metric, such as the DiskspaceUtilization metric for the Monitoring Scripts instance, and click Actions \u003e Share:\nThis metric can be found underSystem/Linux \u003e Filesystem, InstanceId, MountPath.\n3. In the Share Graph URL dialog, right-click and copy the URL, then Close the dialog:\n4. The URL for the specific graph you were looking at is copied into the clipboard. You can paste it into a test email to confirm this. For example:\nThe URL is quite complex. To confirm that it is indeed correct, test it out in another browser tab.\n5. Open another browser tab. Paste the URL into the address field and refresh your browser. You should see the exact same graph as the one you shared earlier. Notice that you need to be logged into the AWS console in order to view the information referenced by the URL. For security reasons, you can only share URLs with other AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users who have the appropriate CloudWatch IAM permissions in your AWS account.\n","description":"Introduction to CloudWatch","title":"Introduction to CloudWatch","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/cloudwatch/introduction-to-cloudwatch/"},{"content":"Lab https://cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-codecommit/\nCreate a repository 1.

It also provides a Runtime API which allows you to use any additional programming languages to author your functions. A runtime is a program that runs a Lambda function’s handler method when the function is invoked. You can include a runtime in your function’s deployment package in the form of an executable file named bootstrap\nWhen you publish a version, AWS Lambda makes a snapshot copy of the Lambda function code (and configuration) in the $LATEST version. A published version is immutable.\nLambda execution role is an IAM role that grants the function permission to access AWS services and resources. Under Attach permissions policies, choose the AWS managed policies AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess.\nAWS managed policies for Lambda features\nDigest Types of lambda invocation RequestResponse. Event. Dryrun. Lambda execution context is a temporary runtime environment that initializes any external dependencies of our Lambda function code, such as database connections or HTTP endpoints Lambda Environment variables are variables that enable you to dynamically pass settings to your function code and libraries, without making changes to your code. Environment variables are key-value pairs that you create and modify as part of your function configuration. Lambda concurrent executions = (invocations per second) x (average execution duration in seconds). Concurrency limit of lambda execution, Default 1000 Reserved - 900 unreserved 100. Will get throttled if it exceeds concurrency limit AWS_PROXY in API gateway is primarily used for Lambda proxy integration. A Lambda authorizer is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API. Lambda authorizer can be used for custom authorization scheme. 2 types: Token based. Request parameter based Lambda authorizer. Lambda deployment configuration: HalfAtATime Canary Linear. AWS Lambda compute platform deployments cannot use an in-place deployment type Increasing memory in lambda will increase CPU in lambda Lambda Versioning: By default, each AWS Lambda function has a single current version of the code. Clients of Lambda function can call a specific version or at the latest implementation Lambda Alias: You can create one or more aliases for our AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. Users can access the function version using the alias ARN Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency Lambda Layer - Layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can trigger pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole is required to enable Lambda to work with DynamoDB API Gateway - Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. Integrating Cloud Watch Events with lambda can be used for scheduling events If there is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend, it will return 502 To resolve lambda throttled exception when using Cognito events, perform retry on sync. Lambda Event hook running order: start -\u003e BeforeAllowTraffic -\u003e AllowTraffic -\u003e After AllowTraffic -\u003e End AWS Lambda runs function code securely within a VPC b default. To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC Lambda Asynchronous invocation can be triggered by Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Amazon Simple Email Service, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, AWS CodeCommit, AWS Config. Lambda Limits: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html Lambda provides 500 MB of additional disk space as a workspace. Lambda logs all stout for a lambda function to CloudWatch Logs. Any additional logging calls used in the function will also be sent to CloudWatch Logs. To connect to a VPC, lambda function execution role must have the following permissions: ec2:Create Networkinterface, ec2:DescribeNetworkinterfaces, ec2:Delete Networkinterface. These permissions are included in the AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole managed policy When lambda execution is hit by concurrency limit, you need to request AWS to increase concurrency limit For stream-based services like Dynamo b streams, that don’t invoke Lambda functions directly, the event source mapping configuration should be made on the Lambda side. A deployment package is a ZIP archive that contains your function code and dependencies. You can unload the package directly to lambda. Or you can use an Amazon S3 bucket and then upload it to lambda. If the deployment package is larger than 50 MB. you must use Amazon 53 Lambda can incur a first run penalty also called cold starts. Cold starts can cause slower than expected behavior on infrequently run functions or functions with high concurrency demands Price Price\nPrice x86\n0.000016667 USD per gigabyte-second 0,20 USD per 1 million requests Arm price\n0,0000133334 USD for each gigabyte-second 0,20 USD for 1 million queries Practice In the AWS Management Console search bar, type Lambda and select Lambda under “Services”:\nhttps://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#\nOn page Functions click Create a function\nAuthor from scratch is selected and enter the following values in the bottom form:\nFunction name: *MyCustomFunc Runtime: Node.js 16.X I select this section because I use the cloudacademy account.

And I’ll also add processing of the message I receive (In the next step in the testing section)\nThe function takes as an object event which contains an array of Records. On the 1st (0) position the object Sns (name of the service SNS Notifications).\nIn the object itself there will be 2 values:\ncook_secs - cooking time (microwave) req_secs - cooking time (prepare) console.log('Loading function'); exports.handler = function(event, context) { console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)); const message = JSON.parse(event.Records[0].Sns.Message); if (message.cook_secs \u003c message.req_secs) { if (message.pre) { context.succeed(\"User ended \" + message.pre + \" preset early\"); } else { context.succeed(\"User ended custom cook time early\"); } } context.succeed(); }; Deploy Test This functionality allows you to test how the function reacts to certain events. Let’s try to add an event from SNS Notifications.\nLet’s choose from the list\nWe get a template in which we make some changes, adjust the field Message - the one that we will process in our function.\nField Message - string, so our object will need to be wrapped in quotes\nTo make the handler understand that we put quotation marks inside quotation marks, we must put a special symbol \\ before the quotation mark.\nFinally we update one line and save it - Create\nNow we click the Test button.\nSince cook_secs in our event was less than req_secs, the function printed the first condition, and below in Function Logs we see the message that we print when we initialize the Loading function\nQuestions Q1 When working with a published version of the AWS Lambda function, you should note that the _____.\nUse the AWS Management Console to create and configure the cluster. Create a cron job to schedule the cluster deployment using the _aws cloudformation deploy_ command Create a configuration file with the .config extension and place it into the .ebextensions folder in the application package. Build an AWS Lambda function that polls to the ElasticBeanstalk environment deployments and create and configure the Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Explanation AWS Secrets Manager\nC\nQ2 A developer is building a streamlined development process for Lambda functions related to S3 storage.The developer needs a consistent, reusable code blueprint that can be easily customized to manage Lambda function definition and deployment, the S3 events to be managed and the Identity Access Management (IAM) policies definition.\nWhich of the following AWS solutions offers is best suited for this objective?\nAWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates AWS Systems Manager AWS Step Functions Explanation Serverless Application Model\n2\nQ3 A developer is adding sign-up and sign-in functionality to an application. The application is required to make an API call to a custom analytics solution to log user sign-in events\nWhich combination of actions should the developer take to satisfy these requirements? (Select TWO.)\nUse Amazon Cognito to provide the sign-up and sign-in functionality Use AWS IAM to provide the sign-up and sign-in functionality Configure an AWS Config rule to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event Invoke an Amazon API Gateway method to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event Execute an AWS Lambda function to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event Explanation Amazon Cognito adds user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to web and mobile applications quickly and easily. Users can also create an AWS Lambda function to make an API call to a custom analytics solution and then trigger that function with an Amazon Cognito post authentication trigger.\n1, 5\nQ4 A developer is designing a web application that allows the users to post comments and receive a real-time feedback.\nWhich architectures meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)\nCreate an AWS AppSync schema and corresponding APIs. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data store. Create a WebSocket API in Amazon API Gateway. Use an AWS Lambda function as the backend and an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data store Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application backed by an Amazon RDS database. Configure the application to allow long-lived TCP/IP sockets. Create a GraphQL endpoint in Amazon API Gateway. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data store. Enable WebSocket on Amazon CloudFront. Use an AWS Lambda function as the origin and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as the data store Explanation AWS AppSync simplifies application development by letting users create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources. AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to get the exact data they need.\nAWS AppSync allows users to build scalable applications, including those requiring real-time updates, on a range of data sources, including Amazon DynamoDB. In Amazon API Gateway, users can create a WebSocket API as a stateful frontend for an AWS service (such as AWS Lambda or DynamoDB) or for an HTTP endpoint.\nThe WebSocket API invokes the backend based on the content of the messages it receives from client applications. Unlike a REST API, which receives and responds to requests, a WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client applications and the backend.\n1, 2\nQ5 A food delivery company is building a feature that requests reviews from customers after their orders are delivered. The solution should be a short-running process that can message customers simultaneously at various contact points including email, text, and mobile push notifications.\nWhich approach best meets these requirements?\nUse EventBridge with Kinesis Data Streams to send messages. Use a Step Function to send SQS messages. Use a Lambda function to send SNS messages. Use AWS Batch and SNS to send messages.

It combines the capabilities of several other tools including:\nPyFlakes: Checks for logical errors. pycodestyle: Checks for the format errors. Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script: Checks the complexity of your code. Step 1: Install Python python --version Step 2: Install Black and Flake8 pip install black pip install flake8 Step 3: Install Python Extension for VS Code Go to the Extensions view in VS Code (View -\u003e Extensions), search for “Python,” and then install it.\nStep 4: Configure Black and Flake8 In the pyproject.toml file, you have the following settings:\nline-length: This is the maximum line length that Black will enforce. You’ve set it to 130. target-version: This specifies the Python versions your project supports. Black may change the way it formats code depending on the Python version targetted. include and exclude: These options define the files Black should format and exclude from formatting, respectively. Create a pyproject.toml file in your project root directory with the following content for Black:\n[tool.black] line-length = 130 target-version = ['py38'] include = '\\.pyi?$' exclude = ''' /( \\.git | \\.venv | \\.eggs | \\.hg | \\.mypy_cache | \\.nox | \\.tox | \\.venv | _build | buck-out | build | dist )/ ''' And a .flake8 file with the following content for Flake8:\n[flake8] max-line-length = 150 ignore = E203, E266, E501, W503, F403, F401 max-complexity = 18 select = B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9 max-complexity: This is complexity checker setting. It’s a measure of the complexity of your functions, methods, and classes. The lower this number, the less complex your code is allowed to be. Step 5: Configure VS Code Settings Go to the Settings in VS Code (File -\u003e Preferences -\u003e Settings) and search for “Python Formatting Provider.” Select “black” from the dropdown list.\nTo set Flake8 as the linter, search for “Python Linting” in the settings and select “flake8.”\nNow, VS Code will automatically use Black and Flake8 to format and lint your Python code, respectively.\nStep 6: Format on file save To run the formatter each time you save a Python file, you’ll need to modify the VS Code settings. Here’s how:\nOpen the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P MacOs(Cmd+Shift+P). Type “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)” and select it. Choose Default Settings or Workspace Settings depend on global or project specific setup. For global “Search for “Editor: Format On Save” in Command Palette search bar and check the box to enable it. Add the following lines in the JSON file for local project/workspace setup: \"python.editor.formatOnSave\": true, \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\" This tells VS Code to run the Python formatter (which you’ve set to Black) every time you save a Python file.\nYou can do the same with Flake8 by enabling linting on save:\n\"python.linting.flake8Enabled\": true, \"python.linting.lintOnSave\": true Groovy with CodeNarc Step 1: Install Groovy Ensure you have Groovy installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:\ngroovy --version Step 2: Install the Groovy Extension for VS Code In your build.gradle file, add:\nStep 3: Set Up CodeNarc apply plugin: 'codenarc' dependencies { codenarc 'org.codenarc:CodeNarc:1.6' } codenarc { configFile = file('config/codenarc/rules.groovy') } Create a config/codenarc/rules.groovy file in your project root directory and add the following content:\nruleset { LineLength { enabled = true priority = 1 maximumLineLength = 150 } } Now, when you run your Gradle build, CodeNarc will check your Groovy files against the rules defined in config/codenarc/rules.groovy.\nJS/TypeScript with ESLint and Prettier Step 1: Install Node.js and npm Before you install ESLint and Prettier, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:\nnode --version npm --version Step 2: Install ESLint and Prettier You can install ESLint and Prettier as devDependencies in your project by running the following command in your terminal:\nnpm install eslint prettier --save-dev Step 3: Install the ESLint and Prettier Extensions for VS Code Search for ESLint and Prettier - Code formatter in the Extensions view in VS Code (View -\u003e Extensions) and install them.\nStep 4: Configure ESLint and Prettier To configure ESLint and Prettier, you need to create two configuration files, .eslintrc.json for ESLint, and .prettierrc for Prettier, in your project root directory.\nFor example, you can create an .eslintrc.json file with the following content for ESLint:\n{ \"env\": { \"browser\": true, \"es6\": true }, \"extends\": \"eslint:recommended\", \"rules\": { \"indent\": [\"error\", 2], \"linebreak-style\": [\"error\", \"unix\"], \"quotes\": [\"error\", \"double\"], \"semi\": [\"error\", \"always\"] } } And a .prettierrc file with the following content for Prettier:\n{ \"semi\": true, \"trailingComma\": \"all\", \"singleQuote\": true, \"printWidth\": 80, \"tabWidth\": 2 } Step 5: Configure VS Code Settings Go to the Settings in VS Code (File -\u003e Preferences -\u003e Settings) and search for “Format On Save.” Check the box to enable it.\nIn the settings, search for “Default Formatter” and select “Prettier - Code formatter” from the dropdown list.\nYou can also add these settings directly to your settings.json file:\n{ \"editor.formatOnSave\": true, \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\", \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": { \"source.fixAll.eslint\": true }, \"[javascript]\": { \"editor.formatOnSave\": false, \"editor.defaultFormatter\": null }, \"[javascriptreact]\": { \"editor.formatOnSave\": false, \"editor.defaultFormatter\": null }, \"[typescript]\": { \"editor.formatOnSave\": false, \"editor.defaultFormatter\": null }, \"[typescriptreact]\": { \"editor.formatOnSave\": false, \"editor.defaultFormatter\": null } } These settings tell VS Code to run Prettier as the default formatter, and also to perform any auto-fixes that ESLint can handle on save.\nNow, VS Code will automatically use ESLint and Prettier to lint and format your JavaScript and TypeScript code, respectively.\n","description":"Setting Up Python and Groovy Linters and Formatters in Visual Studio Code","title":"Linters \u0026 Formatters Setup for Python, Groovy, JavaScript in VSCode","uri":"/en/posts/python-groovy-lint-format-setup/"},{"content":"MacBook Pro Specification 13-inch Apple M1 Pro M1 2020 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD QWERTY = English/Hebrew macOS Monterey (Update always) Homebrew Install Homebrew as package manager for macOS:\n## paste in terminal and follow the instructions /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Update everything in Homebrew to recent version:\nbrew update Add additional source for casks:\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-versions Install GUI applications (read more about these in GUI Applications):\nbrew install --cask \\ appcleaner \\ all-in-one-messenger \\ anaconda \\ brewmate \\ deepl \\ discord \\ disk-inventory-x \\ docker \\ figma \\ google-chrome \\ google-drive \\ grammarly \\ iterm2 \\ itsycal \\ macx-youtube-downloader \\ mongodb-compass \\ notion \\ obs \\ postman \\ rectangle \\ sublime-text \\ syncthing \\ telegram \\ tor-browser \\ transmission \\ utm \\ viber \\ visual-studio-code \\ vlc \\ yandex-disk \\ zoom Install terminal applications (read more about these in Terminal Applications):\nbrew install \\ git \\ jupyterlab \\ ffmpeg \\ nvm Additional GUI Applications GUI Applications Google Chrome Google Chrome (web development, web browsing)\nPreferences\nset default browser always show bookmarks import bookmarks from previous machine Chrome Developer Tools\nNetwork -\u003e only “Fetch/XHR” Search Shortcuts.

A 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the “signal line”, is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.\nHere’s the formula for the MACD:\nMACD = 12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA To calculate the signal line, you take the 9-period EMA of the MACD.\nSignal Line = 9-Period EMA of MACD Example:\nSince MACD requires 26 periods to start, we’ll calculate from the 26th minute:\nMinute Open High Low Close EMA12 EMA26 EMA9 (Signal) MACD 1 $10.0 $11.0 $9.5 $10.0 - - - - 2 $10.1 $12.1 $10.0 $12.0 - - - - 3 $12.2 $15.2 $12.0 $15.0 - - - - 4 $15.1 $15.1 $13.9 $14.0 - - - - 5 $14.1 $16.1 $14.0 $16.0 - - - - 6 $16.1 $16.1 $14.9 $15.0 - - - - 7 $15.1 $17.1 $15.0 $17.0 - - - - 8 $17.1 $17.1 $15.9 $16.0 - - - - 9 $16.1 $18.1 $16.0 $18.0 - - Starts here - 10 $18.1 $18.1 $16.9 $17.0 - - - 11 $17.1 $19.1 $17.0 $19.0 - - - 12 $19.1 $19.1 $17.9 $18.0 Starts here - - 13 $18.1 $20.1 $18.0 $20.0 - - 14 $20.1 $21.1 $20.0 $21.0 - - 15 $21.1 $21.1 $19.9 $20.0 - - 16 $20.1 $22.1 $20.0 $21.0 - - 17 $21.1 $23.1 $21.0 $22.0 - - 18 $22.1 $24.1 $22.0 $23.0 - - 19 $23.1 $25.1 $23.0 $24.0 - - 20 $24.1 $26.1 $24.0 $25.0 - - 21 $25.1 $27.1 $25.0 $26.0 - - 22 $26.1 $28.1 $26.0 $27.0 - - 23 $27.1 $29.1 $27.0 $28.0 - - 24 $28.1 $30.1 $28.0 $29.0 - - 25 $29.1 $31.1 $29.0 $30.0 - - 26 $30.1 $32.1 $30.0 $31.0 Starts here Starts here 27 $31.1 $33.1 $31.0 $32.0 28 $32.1 $34.1 $32.0 $33.0 29 $33.1 $35.1 $33.0 $34.0 30 $34.1 $36.1 $34.0 $35.0 In python it can be calculated in the following way:\nimport pandas as pd # Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame and 'Close' is the column with closing prices df['EMA12'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean() df['EMA26'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean() df['MACD'] = df['EMA12'] - df['EMA26'] df['Signal'] = df['MACD'].ewm(span=9, adjust=False).mean() Pros and Cons Pros:\nTrend Identification: MACD can identify the start of a trend, providing good entry points. Signal Line Crossovers: The MACD’s signal line can provide clear buy and sell signals. Cons:\nFalse Signals: Like any indicator, MACD can produce false signals, particularly in volatile markets. Lag: MACD can sometimes lag behind the market because it’s a trend-following indicator. It may not work well in ranging (non-trending) markets, where price movements can be random. Example of signals True Positive:\nA true positive in MACD is a situation where the MACD line crosses above the signal line and the price goes up, indicating a strong bullish signal, or the MACD line crosses below the signal line and the price goes down, indicating a strong bearish signal.\nThese signals can help traders decide when to enter or exit trades.\nFalse Positive:\nA false positive in MACD is typically a situation where the MACD line crosses above the signal line (potential buy signal), but the price does not go up, or the MACD line crosses below the signal line (potential sell signal), but the price does not go down. It’s important to confirm MACD signals with other indicators or patterns to avoid false positives.\nUse in Real Trading In a real trading scenario, traders often use MACD in conjunction with other indicators to confirm signals and minimize risks. For example, a trader may use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) together with MACD.\nIf MACD gives a buy signal (MACD line crosses above the signal line), and RSI is below 30 (indicating an oversold condition), the trader may consider this as a strong buy signal.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"A comprehensive guide to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) trading indicator.","title":"MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/macd/"},{"content":"This article offers an example of the basic Markdown syntax that can be used and also shows whether the basic elements of HTML are decorated with CSS.\nHeaders Header 1 ======== Header 2 -------- Header 1 Header 2 # h1 ## h2 ### h3 #### h4 ##### h5 ###### h6 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 Paragraph To insert an empty string, you need to put the word wrap symbol twice (press Enter)\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

How does Key Management Service (KMS) implement key rotation?\nKMS supports manual Key Rotation only; you can create new keys any time you want and all data will be re-encrypted with the new key. KMS creates new cryptographic material for your KMS keys every rotation period, and uses the new keys for any upcoming encryption; it also maintains old keys to be able to decrypt data encrypted with those keys. Key rotation is the process of synchronizing keys between configured regions; KMS will synchronize key changes in near-real time once keys are changed. Key rotation is supported through the re-importing of new KMS keys; once you import a new key all data keys will be re-encrypted with the new KMS key. Explanation When you enable automatic key rotation for a customer-managed KMS key, AWS KMS generates new cryptographic material for the KMS key every year. AWS KMS also saves the KMS key’s older cryptographic material so it can be used to decrypt data that it has encrypted.\n10 Alan is managing an environment with regulation and compliance requirements that mandate encryption at rest and in transit.

Explanation 4\n4 A developer is deploying an application that will store files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The files must be encrypted at rest. The developer wants to automatically replicate the files to an S3 bucket in a different AWS Region for disaster recovery.\nHow can the developer accomplish this task with the LEAST amount of configuration?\nEncrypt the files by using server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Enable S3 bucket replication. Encrypt the files by using server-side encryption (SSE) with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). Enable S3 bucket replication. Use the s3 sync command to sync the files to the S3 bucket in the other Region. Configure an S3 Lifecycle configuration to automatically transfer files to the S3 bucket in the other Region. Explanation 2\n5 A serverless application is using AWS Step Functions to process data and save it to a database. The application needs to validate some data with an external service before saving the dat1. The application will call the external service from an AWS Lambda function, and the external service will take a few hours to validate the dat1. The external service will respond to a webhook when the validation is complete.\nA developer needs to pause the Step Functions workflow and wait for the response from the external service.\nWhat should the developer do to meet this requirement?\nUse the .waitForTaskToken option in the Lambda function task state. Pass the token in the body. Use the .waitForTaskToken option in the Lambda function task state. Pass the invocation request. Call the Lambda function in synchronous mode. Wait for the external service to complete the processing. Call the Lambda function in asynchronous mode. Use the Wait state until the external service completes the processing. Explanation 4\n6 A company has an application that writes files to an Amazon S3 bucket. Whenever there is a new file, an S3 notification event invokes an AWS Lambda function to process the file. The Lambda function code works as expected. However, when a developer checks the Lambda function logs, the developer finds that multiple invocations occur for every file.\nWhat is causing the duplicate entries?\nThe S3 bucket name is incorrectly specified in the application and is targeting another S3 bucket. The Lambda function did not run correctly, and Lambda retried the invocation with a delay. Amazon S3 is delivering the same event multiple times. The application stopped intermittently and then resumed, splitting the logs into multiple smaller files. Explanation 1\n7 An AWS Lambda function accesses two Amazon DynamoDB tables.

And if the count of negative numbers is odd, we must have one negative number at the end.\nWe will choose the one smallest by absolute value and keep the rest positive (for simplicity, we consider −0 as a negative number).\nSolution:\ndef solve(): n = inp_int() a = inp_int_list() count_minus = 0 count_zeros = 0 min_val = abs(a[0]) s = 0 # sum for i in range(n): if a[i] \u003c 0: count_minus += 1 if a[i] == 0: count_zeros += 1 v = abs(a[i]) s += v min_val = min(min_val, v) count_minus = count_minus % 2 # if count of odd numbers is negative count_minus -= count_zeros if count_minus \u003c= 0: return s if count_minus == 1: s -= abs(min_val * 2) return s return s def run(): for _ in range(inp_int()): print(solve()) run() Optimization:\ndef solve(): n = inp_int() a = inp_int_list() count_minus = 0 for i in range(n): if a[i] \u003c 0: count_minus += 1 a[i] = abs(a[i]) s = sum(a) # sum if count_minus % 2: return s - min(a) * 2 else: return s F.

Teleporters (Easy Version) https://codeforces.com/contest/1791/problem/G1\ngreedy, sortings *1100\nStatement:\nYou are playing a game where you are given a list of teleporters (0,2,…,𝑛), each located at a point on the number line. The number line includes all integers from 0 to n.\nAt point i, you can do one of three actions:\nMove left one unit: this action costs 1 coin. Move right one unit: this action also costs 1 coin. Use a teleporter at point i: this action costs $a_i$ coins. When you use a teleporter, you are immediately teleported back to point 0. Last statement in the problem means that at any point i on the number line, you have the option to use a teleporter located at that point, which will immediately transport you back to point 0. However, using a teleporter costs a certain number of coins, denoted by $a_i$. For example, if you are at point i = 5, and you use the teleporter located at point 5, you will be immediately transported back to point 0, but you will have to pay the cost $a_i$ in coins to do so.\nEssentially, the teleporters provide a way for you to quickly move back to the starting point (point 0) without having to take multiple steps, but this convenience comes at a cost. You can only use each teleporter once, and you must have enough coins to pay the cost of using it.\nYou start at point 0, and you have c coins to spend. Your goal is to use as many teleporters as possible while still having at least 1 coin left over. You cannot use a teleporter more than once.\nWrite a function max_teleporters(n, c, a) that takes in\nthe length of the number line n the number of coins you have c the list of teleporter costs a. The function should return the maximum number of teleporters you can use given your starting position at 0 and the number of coins you have to spend.\nYou may assume that n, c, and all elements of a are positive integers.\nFor example, the following input should return 2:\nn = 8 c = 32 a = [100, 52, 13, 6, 9, 4, 100, 35] max_teleporters(n, c, a) =\u003e 2 Will use greedy algorithm.\nApproach:\nGiven input: n = 8, c = 32, a = [100, 52, 13, 6, 9, 4, 100, 35]\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of each teleporter\nFor each teleporter at position i, add the index i and the cost a[i] The resulting array cost contains the costs to use each teleporter, accounting for the cost of moving to that teleporter’s position: [101, 54, 16, 10, 14, 10, 107, 43] Step 2: Sort the cost array in ascending order\nSorting the array ensures that we use the cheapest teleporters first Step 3: Compute the maximum number of teleporters we can use\nInitialize a variable used to 0 to keep track of how many teleporters we’ve used Iterate over the sorted cost array, adding the cost of each teleporter to a running total total If the current total is less than or equal to c, we can use the current teleporter, so increment used If the current total is greater than c, we’ve run out of coins and can’t use any more teleporters, so exit the loop Return the final value of used Step 4: Return the maximum number of teleporters we can use\nThe maximum number of teleporters we can use is the value of used computed in Step 3: 2 Solution:\ndef max_teleporters(n, c, a): # First, we add the index of each teleporter to its cost, so that we can easily # calculate the cost to reach each teleporter from the starting position (0). for i in range(n): a[i] += i + 1 # We then sort the list of teleporter costs in ascending order, so that we can # use the cheapest teleporters first. a.sort() # We iterate over the sorted list of teleporter costs, using as many teleporters # as possible while still having at least one coin remaining. We keep track of the # number of teleporters used in the \"used\" variable. used = 0 for cost in a: if cost \u003c= c: used += 1 c -= cost else: break # Finally, we return the number of teleporters used. return used Explanation from Codeforces:\nIt’s easy to see that it’s optimal to only move right or to use a portal once we are at it. We can notice that when we teleport back, the problem is independent of the previous choices.\nWe still are at point 0 and have some portals left. Thus, we can just find out the individual cost of each portal, sort portals by individual costs, and take them from smallest to largest by cost as long as we can.\nThe cost of portal 𝑖 is $𝑖+𝑎𝑖_$ (since we pay \u0026𝑎_𝑖\u0026 to use it and need 𝑖 moves to get to it).\nG2. Teleporters (Hard Version) https://codeforces.com/contest/1791/problem/G2\nbinary, search, greedy, sortings *1900\nExplanation from Codeforces:\nPlease also refer to the tutorial for the easy version.\nIf we are not at the first taken portal, the problem is still independent for each portal, but this time the cost of a portal is $𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑎_𝑖+𝑖,𝑎_𝑖+𝑛+1−𝑖)$ (since we can come to a portal either from point 0 or point $𝑛+1$).\nSo, we again sort the portals by their costs. But this time, we need to make sure that the first taken portal is taken from point 0, so we will iterate over all portals and check the maximum amount of portals we can take if we use it as the first one.\nWe can check this using prefix sums over the minimum cost array and binary searching, checking if the amount of considered portals taken doesn’t exceed the number of coins we initially have (we also have to deal with the case when the portal we are considering is included both times as the initial portal and in the minimum cost prefix).\n","description":"Codeforces Round #849 (Div. 4) / 1791","title":"Round #849/1791 (Div. 4)","uri":"/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/contests/849-div-4-1791/"},{"content":" Contest problems A.

You can’t create multiple records that have the same name and type, but you can specify multiple values in the same record, such as multiple IP addresses.\nFailover routing policy – use when you want to configure active-passive failover.\nGeolocation routing policy – use when you want to route internet traffic to your resources based on the location of your users.\nGeoproximity routing policy – use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.\nYou can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource. The effect of changing the bias for your resources depends on a number of factors, including the following: The number of resources that you have. How close the resources are to one another. The number of users that you have near the border area between geographic regions. Latency routing policy – use when you have resources in multiple locations and you want to route traffic to the resource that provides the best latency.\nIP-based routing policy – use when you want to route traffic based on your users’ locations, and know where the IP address or traffic is coming from.\nMultivalue answer routing policy – use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.\nWeighted routing policy – use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.\nWhen you register a domain or transfer domain registration to Route 53, it configures the domain to renew automatically. The automatic renewal period is typically one year, although the registries for some top-level domains (TLDs) have longer renewal periods.\nWhen you register a domain with Route 53, it creates a hosted zone that has the same name as the domain, assigns four name servers to the hosted zone, and updates the domain to use those name servers.\nDigest Route 53 is AWS DNS service Map domain names to EC2 instances, Load Balancers and 53 buckets Routing Policies Simple - Traffic routed to a single resource Weighted - Traffic routed to a resource = weight assigned to the resource/sum of all the weights Latency - serves requests from the AWS region with low latency Geographical - routes the traffic based on the location of the request origin Failover - routes traffic to primary when primary healthy; secondary when primary is unhealthy Multivalue Answer - routs randomly to multiple healthy resources VPC - private network on AWS platform Subnet, NAT Instance, NAT Gatewav, Internet Gatewav, NACLs, Route Table VPC Wizard Single public subnet Public and Private subnet (NAT) Public and private subnet and AWS managed VPN access Private subnet only and AWS managed VPN access VPC Peering - helps transfer of data VPC Flow logs - helps capture information about incoming/outgoing traffic Direct Connect - dedicated connection from on premises network to VPC Price Pay only for what you use.\nCurrent price\nUse Cases Domain Registration / transfer Manage network traffic globally Set up private DNS ","description":"Amazon Route 53 - A reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications","title":"Route 53","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/route53/"},{"content":"About The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the RSI is a very popular indicator that is used primarily to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a market.\nCalculating The RSI is calculated using the following steps:\nCalculate the average gain and the average loss over the specified period (usually 14 periods). Compute the relative strength (RS) which is the ratio of average gain to average loss. The RSI is then calculated using the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)) Formula RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))\nWhere:\nRS: (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss Pros and Cons Pros:\nRSI is a versatile indicator that can be used in trending or ranging markets. It helps identify potential reversals, overbought/oversold conditions, and divergence. Cons:\nDuring strong trends, the RSI may remain overbought or oversold for extended periods. False signals can occur, especially during choppy market conditions.

However, the price continues to increase in the next minutes, rendering this a false sell signal.\nUse in Real Trading In real trading, RSI is often used in conjunction with other indicators to increase the robustness of the signals.\nFor instance, traders might look for price action patterns (like support/resistance breaks) or confirmations from other indicators before acting on an RSI signal.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"A comprehensive guide to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trading indicator.","title":"RSI - Relative Strength Index","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/rsi/"},{"content":"A Segment Tree is a data structure used for efficiently processing queries over intervals or ranges. It is commonly used for solving problems that involve finding information about a set of elements and their sub-intervals.\nSince a Segment Tree is a binary tree, a simple linear array can be used to represent the Segment Tree. Before building the Segment Tree, one must figure what needs to be stored in the Segment Tree’s node?.\nEach leaf node represents a single element, and each internal node represents the union of its children’s ranges. Queries are performed by traversing the tree from the root to the leaves, and aggregating information about the ranges that intersect with the query interval.\nExample 1, consider a set of numbers and the task of finding the minimum value in a range of these numbers. The Segment Tree can be used to solve this problem by storing the minimum value of each range in the tree’s internal nodes, and answering queries by searching for the smallest value in the portion of the tree that covers the query interval.\nExample 2, if the question is to find the sum of all the elements in an array from L indices to R, then at each node (except leaf nodes) the sum of its children nodes is stored.\nThe Segment Tree can be constructed in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the original set, and it can answer queries in O(log n) time. This makes it an efficient data structure for processing queries over large datasets.\nTo study the topic “segment tree” you need to know the following concepts:\narrays loops conditional operators bitwise operations A Segment Tree is a dynamic data structure used to perform operations on and update intervals. It supports two operations: Element update (update) on a given range and request (query) on the sum of elements in a given range.\nLet’s perform the following task: we have an array and we want to find the sum of the elements in a given range.\nFor this task, we can use a segment tree. It is constructed as a binary tree, where each node represents an interval and the value of the node is the sum of the elements in that interval.\nFundamentals:\nDefinition of a sum element in a segment tree: A sum element in a segment tree is the sum of all elements in the range it represents.\nConstructing a segment tree: A segment tree can be constructed from an array of numbers. Each node in the tree represents a range of elements in the array and stores the sum of the elements in that range.\nImplementation of operations: The implementation of various operations in a segment tree essentially depends on its structure. However, there are several operations that are often used in various tasks:\nUpdate value in the array: This operation allows you to change the value of an element in an array. It is usually implemented using a recursive tree traversal.\nQuery Value: This operation allows you to query the value of an element in an array. It is also usually implemented using recursive tree traversal.\nQuery for a sum: This operation allows you to query the sum of values in an array on a given interval. It is usually implemented by recursive tree traversal and sum counting\nBuilding a spanning tree Since the tree is binary, each vertex will have up to two descendants.\nGraphically it looks as follows (for an array of 8 elements):\nAt the topmost vertex the segment from the beginning of the array to the last element is fixed.\nOn the left is the left half of the parent ([0 1 2 3]). On the right is the right half ()[4 5 6 7]). And so on up to the last node with a segment of one element.\nTake the array a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]. We use it to build a tree of segments to write the sums of these segments in each node.\nThe structure of such a tree is as follows:\n💡 The tree contains less than 2n vertices. 2*n-1\nThe number of vertices in the worst case is estimated by the sum $n + \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{4} + \\frac{n}{8} + \\ldots + 1 \u003c 2n$\nLet us display such a tree as an array:\nThere are 9 vertices in such a tree. The array will consist of 9 elements. tree[0] = A[0:4] tree[1] = A[0:2] tree[2] = A[3:4] tree[3] = A[0:1] tree[4] = A[2:2] tree[5] = A[3:3] tree[6] = A[4:4] tree[7] = A[0:0] tree[8] = A[1:1] This tree covers all vertices.\nWith this structure, you can store different data in the vertex values, such as the sum of the segment, the smallest/the largest number, or other aggregate data on the segments.\nImplementing a segment tree in Python Initializing the tree\na = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]\nSince the most recent nodes are segments of length == 1. So we start the process of creation with them, gradually rising to the level above.\n💡 The tree contains less than 2n vertices. 💡 Bottom vertex - the length of the segment is equal to 1.\ndef build_tree(array): n = len(array) tree = [0] * 2 * n # The tree contains less than **2n** vertices. for i in range(n): tree[n + i] = a[i] # the lowest tops of the tree # add parent nodes for i in reversed(range(n)): tree[i] = tree[2 * i] + tree[2 * i + 1] print(i, tree) \u003e\u003e array = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7] \u003e\u003e build_tree(array) 4 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, -2, 8, -7] 3 [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, -2, 8, -7] 2 [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, -2, 8, -7] 1 [0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, -2, 8, -7] 0 [3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, -2, 8, -7] Calculating the sum on the segment:\nThe function gets the indexes of the original array.\nWhen we created the tree from the source array, we placed each individual element on the new index [n + i].\n💡 So when the function takes an index, we first find the bottommost element in the tree. It is located in the new array by the index [length_of_source_array + index]\n# calculate the sum on the segment def query_tree(l, r): global tree, n sum = 0 l += n # current item index r += n while l \u003c= r: if l % 2 == 1: # if the index is odd sum += tree[l] l += 1 if r % 2 == 0: sum += tree[r] r -= 1 l //= 2 # floor division. 8 // 3 = 2 r //= 2 return sum \u003e\u003e a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7] \u003e\u003e n = len(a) \u003e\u003e tree = build_tree(a) \u003e\u003e query_tree(0, 4) # sum([1, 3, -2, 8, -7]) 3 \u003e\u003e query_tree(1, 3) # sum([3, -2, 8]) 9 \u003e\u003e query_tree(4, 4) -7 We get the SegmentTree class:\nSum function or any other function can be turned on at the time of tree generation\nclass SegmentTree: def __init__(self, a): self.n = len(a) self.tree = [0] * 2 * self.n for i in range(self.n): self.tree[self.n + i] = a[i] for i in range(self.n -

Encryption: Kinesis Data Streams can be encrypted using an AWS managed or customer-managed, KMS key. Data retention: A Kinesis Data Stream can retain data for a configurable amount of time between 24 and 168 hours.

The stream you simulated is providing timestamps with milliseconds. This is why the CASE WHEN statement that checks for a ten-second interval includes (10 * 1000), it’s multiplying ten by one thousand to get ten seconds in milliseconds.\nTip: you can increase the height of the SQL editor text-box by dragging the grey bar at the bottom.\n4. To execute the SQL statements, click Save and run application:\nThe query will take up to a couple of minutes to execute and start returning results.\nOccasionally you may see an error caused by the fifteen-second interval, if you do, re-run the query by clicking Save and run application again.\nTake a look at the results. Notice that only some records have a value for session_timestamp. This is because the CASE WHEN statement in the query supplies a value of null when:\nThe interval between event timestamps is less than ten seconds There is no preceding event Also notice that below the SQL Code editor, there are two streams, the INTERMEDIATE_SQL_STREAM, and an error_stream. The error stream is where any errors that occur during the execution of the SQL will be delivered to.\n5. In the SQL editor window, under the current SQL statements, add the following:\nCREATE OR REPLACE STREAM \"DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM\" ( \"user_id\" CHAR(7), \"session_id\" VARCHAR(50), \"session_time\" VARCHAR(20), \"latest_time\" VARCHAR(20) ); CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP \"STREAM_PUMP2\" AS INSERT INTO \"DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM\" SELECT STREAM \"user_id\", \"user_id\"||'_'||\"device_type\"||'_'||TIMESTAMP_TO_CHAR('HH:mm:ss', LAST_VALUE(\"session_timestamp\") IGNORE NULLS OVER (PARTITION BY \"user_id\" RANGE INTERVAL '24' HOUR PRECEDING)) AS \"session_id\", TIMESTAMP_TO_CHAR('HH:mm:ss', \"session_timestamp\") AS \"session_time\", TIMESTAMP_TO_CHAR('HH:mm:ss', \"event_timestamp\") AS \"latest_time\" FROM \"INTERMEDIATE_SQL_STREAM\" WHERE \"user_id\" = 'user1'; These SQL statements do the following:\nCreates a stream called DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM Creates a PUMP that selects from the INTERMEDIATE_SQL_STREAM Constructs a session_id by combining the user, device type and time Restricts the query to user1 using a WHERE clause Something else to note about these statements is that the session and event timestamps are being converted to times.\n6. To run the updated query, click Save and run application.\nYou will see results similar to:\nYour times will be different.\nNotice that the session_time values are more than ten seconds apart. And that the seconds’ interval of the latest_time column between the rows that have a session time, is ten seconds or less.\n7. To see only the rows for new sessions, replace the last line of the query with the following:\nWHERE \"session_timestamp\" IS NOT NULL; This change to the WHERE clause of the last SQL statement removes the restriction of the query to user1, and removes rows where the value of session_timestamp is null.\n8. Click Save and run application to re-run your query.\nYou will see results similar to the following:\nYour results will be different.\nThe results now contain only session boundary rows for each of the users.\nLeave this browser tab open with the query running in Kinesis Data Analytics.\nCreating an AWS Lambda function to Store Sessions in an Amazon DynamoDB Table 1.

It is called a ‘moving’ average because as new prices become available, the oldest prices are dropped and the average recalculates.\nMinute Open High Low Close SMA 1 $10.0 $11.0 $9.5 $10.0 - 2 $10.1 $12.1 $10.0 $12.0 - 3 $12.2 $15.2 $12.0 $15.0 - 4 $15.1 $15.1 $13.9 $14.0 - 5 $14.1 $16.1 $14.0 $16.0 $13.4 Using our given market data and specifically the closing prices, here’s how the 5-minute SMA would be calculated after Minute 5:\nMinute 1-5 close prices: $10.0, $12.0, $15.0, $14.0, $16.0 SMA = (10.0 + 12.0 + 15.0 + 14.0 + 16.0) / 5 = $13.4 The 5-minute SMA after the 5th minute would be $13.4.\nPros and Cons Pros:\nThe SMA is simple and easy to calculate and understand. It smooths out price fluctuations and helps to filter out the “noise” of the market. It’s useful for identifying trend directions over the specified period. Cons:\nThe SMA is a lagging indicator, meaning it’s based on past prices and tends to be slow to respond to recent price changes. Because it equally weighs all data points, it might not accurately reflect recent changes in the market. It might give false signals in volatile markets because it doesn’t adapt to market changes as quickly as some other indicators. Example of signals Traders often use two SMAs: a short-term one and a long-term one. When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, it’s considered a bullish (buy) signal. When it crosses below, it’s a bearish (sell) signal.\nTrue Positive:\nIn an uptrending market, the short-term SMA might cross above the long-term SMA, correctly indicating a continuing upward trend and a good time to buy.\nFalse Positive:\nLet’s say the market is in a sideways trend (prices fluctuate within a narrow range). A brief price spike could cause the short-term SMA to cross above the long-term SMA, generating a buy signal. However, this could be misleading as the overall trend hasn’t changed.\nUse in Real Trading In real trading, SMA can be paired with other indicators for better results.\nFor instance, a trader might use SMA in conjunction with the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI could help confirm whether the market is overbought or oversold when the SMAs cross.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"SMA Trading indicator","title":"SMA - Simple Moving Average","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/sma/"},{"content":"pandoc mardown -\u003e pdf\nCreate pdf file from .md in multiple folders\nprepare:\nbrew install basictex # search for cyrillic fonts fc-list | grep к\\ brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts brew install --cask font-m-plus brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts brew install --cask font-m-plus brew install --cask font-m-plus-1 brew install --cask font-m-plus-1-code ```sh pandoc --pdf-engine xelatex \\ --variable mainfont=\"M+ 1p\" --variable sansfont=\"M+ 1p\" --variable monofont=\"M+ 1m\" \\ -V geometry:\"top=1cm, bottom=2cm, left=1cm, right=1cm\" \\ --file-scope \\ --highlight-style=tango \\ -s \\ --toc-depth=1 \\ --variable=toc-title:\" \" \\ --top-level-division=chapter \\ --standalone \\ --self-contained \\ --from=markdown \\ $(find . -name '*.ru.md') \\ -o book.pdf Convert all video to audio with ffmpeg in current directory\n#!/bin/bash # Check if ffmpeg is installed command -v ffmpeg \u003e/dev/null 2\u003e\u00261 || { echo \u003e\u00262 \"ffmpeg is required but not installed.

It was developed by George Lane in the 1950s.\nCalculating Formula The Stochastic Oscillator is calculated using the following formula:\n%K = 100[(C - L14) / (H14 - L14)] where:\nC = the most recent closing price L14 = the lowest price traded of the 14 previous trading sessions H14 = the highest price traded during the same 14-day period %K = the current value of the stochastic indicator The “%D” line is then a 3-day simple moving average of %K.\nPros and Cons Pros:\nThe Stochastic Oscillator can provide insights into potential overbought and oversold conditions. It can also be used to identify divergences, short-term overbought and oversold conditions, and generate trading signals. Cons:\nThe Stochastic Oscillator can stay in overbought or oversold territory for a long time, leading to many false signals in trending markets. As a lagging indicator, it might send a late signal, causing the trader to miss a big part of the trend. Example of signals Buy Signal: A buy signal might be identified when the Stochastic Oscillator crosses above the %D line (bullish divergence). Sell Signal: Conversely, a sell signal might be identified when the Stochastic Oscillator crosses below the %D line (bearish divergence). Use in Real Trading The Stochastic Oscillator is typically used with other oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) to confirm trading signals.\nPython Implementation Click here to view this notebook in full screen ","description":"Stochastic Oscillator Trading Indicator","title":"Stochastic Oscillator - Momentum Indicator","uri":"/en/posts/trading-indicators/stochastic_oscillator/"},{"content":" LeetCode solutions RU] - Email LeetCode solutions EN - Email ","description":"","title":"Subscription","uri":"/en/p/subscribe/"},{"content":" https://www.buymeacoffee.com/romankurnovskii https://rom.gumroad.com/ https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79828420 ","description":"","title":"Support me","uri":"/en/p/supportme/"},{"content":"Common options z compress with gzip c create an archive u append files which are newer than the corresponding copy ibn the archive f filename of the archive v verbose, display what is inflated or deflated a unlike of z, determine compression based on file extension Create tar named archive.tar containing directory tar cf archive.tar /path/files Concatenate files into a single tar tar -cf archive.tar /path/files Extract the contents from archive.tar tar xf archive.tar Create a gzip compressed tar file name archive.tar.gz tar czf archive.tar.gz /path/files Extract a gzip compressed tar file tar xzf archive.tar.gz Create a tar file with bzip2 compression tar cjf archive.tar.bz2 /path/files Extract a bzip2 compressed tar file tar xjf archive.tar.bz2 List content of tar file tar -tvf archive.tar ","description":"tar command Cheat Sheet","title":"Tar command Cheat Sheet","uri":"/en/posts/cheat-sheet-command-tar/"},{"content":"1.

It then assigns a key value that is a combination of the uploaded file name and the folder name. In this lab step, you will upload a file to your bucket. The process is similar to uploading a single file, multiple files, or a folder with files in it.\nIn order to complete this lab step, you have to upload the cloudacademy-logo.png file from your local file storage into an S3 folder you created earlier.\nDownload the Cloud Academy logo from the following location: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/clouda-labs/scripts/s3/cloudacademy-logo.png (If the image is not downloaded for you, simply right-click the image and select Save image as to download it to your local file system.)\nInstructions Click on the cloudfolder folder. You are placed within the empty folder in your S3 bucket: Note: Click the folder name itself, not the checkbox for the folder name. If you select the folder checkbox then upload a file, it will be placed above the folder (not inside it).\nClick the Upload button.\nClick Add Files:\nA file picker will appear.\nBrowse to and select the local copy of cloudacademy-logo.png file that you downloaded earlier: The logo is added to the list of files that are ready to upload. You have several options at this point:\nAdd more files Upload However, there is another method that some users prefer to add files for upload.\nCheck the file and click on Remove:\nThis time, rather than browsing to a file, drag and drop the logo file onto the wizard. The wizard adds it to the list of files to upload.\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Upload to upload the file:\nYou will see a blue notification that the file is uploading and then a green notification that the upload has been completed successfully.\nThe file is placed in the folder in your bucket:\n","description":"Uploading a File to Amazon S3","title":"Upload a file to S3","uri":"/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/s3/upload-file-to-s3/"},{"content":"Today, I tackled a LeetCode programming problem that pushed me to rediscover a forgotten concept and devise a creative solution to share my learning experience with others.\nThe problem centered around a backtracking algorithm. Although I had previously explored this topic, I couldn’t quite remember the exact steps and logic involved. Determined to refresh my memory, I set out not only to solve the problem but also to find a way to make it easier for myself and others to visualize and comprehend the algorithm in the future.\nI started by rewriting the algorithm from scratch, carefully examining each step and ensuring I understood the logic behind it. Once satisfied with my progress, I decided to create a video using Visual Studio Code’s debugger to capture the entire problem-solving process. I focused on problem 131: Palindrome Partitioning and meticulously documented every step from beginning to end.\nArmed with the video, I wanted to make it available on my website for others who might benefit from it. However, my website was built using the Hugo static site generator, and I soon realized that embedding the video wouldn’t be as straightforward as I initially thought. I needed a shortcode to make it work.\nA shortcode is a compact piece of code that enables users to embed various types of content, such as videos, into their website without having to write complex HTML or JavaScript. It would allow me to seamlessly integrate the video into my website, making it accessible to everyone.\n{{- $src := .Get \"src\" -}} {{- $title := .Get \"title\" -}} \u003cvideo width=\"100%\" controls\u003e \u003csource src=\"{{ $src }}\" type=\"video/mp4\"\u003e Your browser does not support the video tag. \u003c/video\u003e {{ if $title }} \u003cfigcaption\u003e{{ $title }}\u003c/figcaption\u003e {{ end }} This shortcode takes in two parameters, src and title. The src parameter specifies the video file’s URL, while the title parameter is optional and displays a caption below the video. To use the shortcode, simply include the following code in your Hugo markdown file:\n{{ \u003c video src=\"path/to/your/video.mp4\" title=\"Problem 131: Palindrome Partitioning\" \u003e}} By creating and using this shortcode, I successfully embedded my video into my Hugo site, making it available for others to learn from.\nThis experience has reaffirmed the importance of perseverance and innovation in overcoming challenges. Whether it’s relearning an algorithm or finding creative ways to share knowledge, facing obstacles head-on is an essential part of personal and professional development.\nTo try copy and use this shortcode from repo.\nLeetcode problem solution and debug video you can check on this page.\n","description":"Visualize Algorithms - Rediscovering Backtracking","title":"Visualize Algorithms - Rediscovering Backtracking","uri":"/en/stories/001-rediscovering-backtracking-algo/"},{"content":"About AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture.\nDocumentation User Guide X-Ray allows software engineers to view the state of a system at a glance, identify potential bottlenecks, and make informed operational decisions to improve performance and reliability. X-Ray inspects application code using a combination of machine and customer-provided data to identify potential bottlenecks and analyze performance and performance trends for each test scenario.\nTerminology AWS X-Ray receives data from services as segments. X-Ray then groups segments that have a common request into traces. X-Ray processes the traces to generate a service graph that provides a visual representation of your application\nX-Ray Trace Hierarchy: Trace \u003e Segment \u003e Sub Segment\nTrace\nAn X-Ray trace is a set of data points that share the same trace ID.\nSegments\nA segment is a JSON representation of a request that your application serves.\nA trace segment records information about the original request, information about the work that your application does locally, and subsegments with information about downstream calls that your application makes to AWS resources, HTTP APIs, and SQL databases.\nSubsegments\nSubsegments provide more granular timing information and details about downstream calls that your application made to fulfill the original request.\nAnnotations\nAn X-Ray annotation is system-defined, or user-defined data associated with a segment A segment can contain multiple annotations. Annotations are used to describe the request, the response, and other information about the segment Can be used for adding system or user-defined data to segments and subsegments that you want to index for search. Sampling\nX-Ray traces are sampled at a rate that you specify. The rate is specified in the sampling_rate field of the sampling object in the config object.\nMetadata\nX-Ray traces contain metadata that is useful for understanding the trace.\nMetadata (Key / value pairs) is not indexed and cannot be used for searching Digest Trace request across microservices/AWS services\nAnalyze, Troubleshoot errors, Solve performance issues Gather tracing information From applications/components/AWS Services Tools to view, filter and gain insights (Ex: Service Map) How does Tracing work?\nUnique trace ID assigned to every client request X-Amzn-Trace-Id:Root=1-5759e988-bd862e3fe Each service in request chain sends traces to X-Ray with trace ID X-Ray gathers all the information and provides visualization How do you reduce performance impact due to tracing? Sampling - Only a sub set of requests are sampled (Configurable) How can AWS Services and your applications send tracing info? Step 1 : Update Application Code Using X-Ray SDK Step 2: Use X-Ray agents (EASY to use in some services! Ex: AWS Lambda) Segments and Sub-segments can include an annotations object containing one or more fields that X-Ray indexes for use with Filter Expressions. It is indexed. Use up to 50 annotations per trace.\nTotal sampled request per second = Reservoir size + ((incoming requests per second - reservoir size) * fixed rate)\nDefault sampling X-ray SDK first request each second and 5% of any additional requests\nTracing header can be added in http request header\nAnnotations vs Segments vs Subsegments vs metadata\nX-ray daemon listens for traffic on UDP port 2000\nX-ray SDK provides interceptors to add your code to trace incoming HTTP requests.\nX-ray in EC2: You need the X-Ray daemon to be running on your EC2 instances in order to send data to X-Ray. User data script could be used to install the X-Ray daemon in EC2 instance.\nX-ray in ECS: In Amazon ECS, create a Docker image that runs the X-Ray daemon, upload it to a Docker image repository, and then deploy it to your Amazon ECS cluster.\nX-ray in elastic beanstalk: Enable the X-Ray daemon by including the xray-daemon.config configuration file in the .ebextensions directory of your source code\nAWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a micro-service architecture.\nA segment can break down the data about the work done into subsegments. Subsegments provide more granular timing information and details about - downstream calls that your application made to fulfill the original request.\nAdd annotations to subsegment document if you want to trace downstream calls.\nSegments and subsegment can include a metadata object containing one or more fields with values of any type, including objects and arrays.\nTracing header is added in the HTTP request header. A tracing header (X-Amzn-Trace-ld) can originate from the X-Ray SDK, an AWS service, or the - client request.\nUse the GetTraceSummaries API to get the list of trace IDs of the application and then retrieve the list of traces using BatchGetTraces API in - order to develop the custom debug tool\nPrice Current price\nUse Cases Type: Developer Tools\nAlternatives Google Stackdriver Azure Monitor Elastic Observability Datadog Splunk AWS X-Ray supports applications running on:\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) AWS Lambda WS Elastic Beanstalk Practice Questions Q1 You joined an application monitoring team.
