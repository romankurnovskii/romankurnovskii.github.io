Problem Statement Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution might be to convert the integer to a string and check if it reads the same both ways. However, this challenge encourages solving it without such conversion.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips By reversing the number and comparing it to the original, you can determine if it&amp;rsquo;s a palindrome.
Approach Instead of converting the number to a string, we can reverse its digits using mathematical operations and then compare the reversed number to the original number.</description></item><item><title>11.

Problem Statement The task is to determine if the given list of numbers contains an increasing subsequence of length three. This means we need to find three indices i, j, and k in the list such that i &amp;lt; j &amp;lt; k and nums[i] &amp;lt; nums[j] &amp;lt; nums[k].
Naive Solution One possible naive solution is to use three nested loops to go through all possible triples in the list and check if they are increasing. But this solution is very inefficient, has a time complexity of O(n³), and does not meet the follow-up constraints of the problem.</description></item><item><title>345. Reverse Vowels of a String</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/345/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/345/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given a string s, the task is to reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it. The vowels are &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo;, and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.
Naive Solution The naive approach to solve this problem would be to:
Initialize an empty string result. Traverse the given string s from the start to the end. If the current character is a vowel, find the next vowel in the string starting from the end, add it to result, and remove it from the string.</description></item><item><title>392.

Problem Statement Given an encoded string, the task is to decode it to produce a string. The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to repeatedly look for a pattern in the string where there is a number followed by square brackets. For each such pattern found, replace it with the string inside the square brackets repeated &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; times. This would work but might not be the most efficient solution, especially for nested brackets.</description></item><item><title>443.

Problem Statement Given a list of characters, chars, you are required to compress the list using the following algorithm:
Start with an empty string, s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars: If the group&amp;rsquo;s length is 1, append the character to s. Otherwise, append the character followed by the group&amp;rsquo;s length. The compressed string s should be stored back in the chars list. The length of the group that is 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.</description></item><item><title>605.

Задача Дана длинная грядка, на которой некоторые участки уже засажены, а некоторые нет. Однако цветы нельзя сажать на соседние участки.
Подход Чтобы решить эту задачу, мы будем итерироваться по каждому участку грядки. Если участок пустой и его соседи (если они существуют) тоже пусты, мы сажаем цветок и уменьшаем наш счетчик.
Алгоритм Итерируемся по каждому участку грядки. Если участок пустой, проверяем его соседей. Если левый сосед пустой или его нет (начало грядки), проверяем правого соседа. Если правый сосед пустой или его нет (конец грядки), сажаем цветок на текущий участок и уменьшаем n.</description></item><item><title>643.

Problem Statement Imagine a row of asteroids moving in space. Each asteroid has a size (given by its absolute value) and a direction it&amp;rsquo;s moving in (given by its sign: positive for right, negative for left). All asteroids move at the same speed. Your task is to determine the final state of the asteroids after all collisions have been resolved.
Two important points to note:
When two asteroids of different directions meet, the smaller one explodes. If they are of the same size, both explode.</description></item><item><title>1004.

Problem Statement Given a binary array nums and an integer k, the task is to return the maximum number of consecutive 1&amp;rsquo;s in the array, with the possibility to flip at most k 0&amp;rsquo;s.
Naive Solution A straight forward approach is to try flipping every combination of k zeros and checking for the longest sequence of 1&amp;rsquo;s. This would involve nested loops, with the outer loop iterating through the array and the inner loops flipping zeros and calculating sequences of 1&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/1071/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/1071/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement The problem is about finding a greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. The term &amp;ldquo;GCD&amp;rdquo; might be familiar from mathematics, as the largest number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. Here, we extend the idea to strings: a string x is a GCD of strings str1 and str2 if x can be repeatedly appended to itself to obtain str1 and str2.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to find all possible divisors of str1 and str2, and then find the largest common divisor.</description></item><item><title>1207.

Problem Statement Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to create a dictionary to store the count of each integer, then iterate over the dictionary and compare each count with the counts of other integers. This approach requires O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the length of the array. This is not efficient for large input sizes.</description></item><item><title>1431.

Problem Statement Given a string s and an integer k, the task is to return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.
Vowel letters in English are &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo;.
Naive Solution The most straightforward solution to this problem is to take every possible substring of length k and count the number of vowels in each of them. This can be done using nested loops. The outer loop runs through each character in the string while the inner loop counts the vowels for each substring of length k.</description></item><item><title>1493.
