What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. Representing a Binary Tree in Python
To represent a binary tree in Python, we can create a class called Node to represent each node in the tree. Each node will have a value and references to its left and right children.
If a node doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a left or right child, the reference will be set to None.</description></item></channel></rss>
