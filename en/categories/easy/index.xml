Palindrome Number
Problem Statement Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution might be to convert the integer to a string and check if it reads the same both ways. However, this challenge encourages solving it without such conversion.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips By reversing the number and comparing it to the original, you can determine if it&amp;rsquo;s a palindrome.
Approach Instead of converting the number to a string, we can reverse its digits using mathematical operations and then compare the reversed number to the original number.</description></item><item><title>13.

The column titles in an Excel sheet are designed similar to a base-26 number system. The columns start from &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; (which is 1) to &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo; (which is 26), then after &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo;, the column titles go to &amp;lsquo;AA&amp;rsquo; (which is 27), &amp;lsquo;AB&amp;rsquo; (28), and so on.
This problem is essentially asking us to convert a base-26 number (represented by uppercase English letters) to a decimal number.
That means that for each &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; index in columnTitle we already pass alphabet.</description></item><item><title>190.

This task involves understanding how binary representation works. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit value, where each bit represents a power of 2, from 2^0 (the least significant bit) to 2^31 (the most significant bit).
Unsigned Integers (often called &amp;ldquo;uints&amp;rdquo;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).
Naive Solution A naive solution to this problem could involve converting the number to a binary string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer.</description></item><item><title>191.

Problem Statement Given an integer value represented in binary format, we need to count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; bits in its binary representation.
Naive Solution The naive solution for this problem would be to convert the binary number into a string and then simply iterate over the string and count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;s. However, this solution is not optimal and is not taking advantage of the properties of binary numbers.
Algorithm The optimal solution for this problem involves using bitwise operation.</description></item><item><title>202.

Problem Statement In this problem, we are given a number n. We have to determine whether this number is a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</description></item><item><title>206.

Problem Statement Reverse a given singly linked list and return its head. A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Naive Solution A naive approach could be to traverse the entire linked list once to read all its elements into an array. Then, we could reverse the array and construct a new linked list from it. This would work, but it takes up additional space for the array.</description></item><item><title>234.

Problem Statement Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
Naive Solution A simple solution to this problem is to:
traverse the linked list storing the value of each node in an array. Then, we could compare the array with its reversed version.
If they match, the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.
This solution takes O(n) time (where n is the number of nodes in the list), as we need to traverse the list once.</description></item><item><title>283.

In this problem, we are given a flowerbed represented by an integer array flowerbed, where 0 represents an empty plot and 1 represents a plot with a flower.
We need to determine if we can plant n new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the rule that no two adjacent plots can have flowers.
Naive Solution To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the flowerbed and check each plot. If a plot is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty, we can plant a flower in that plot.</description></item><item><title>643.

Naive Solution A naive approach could involve maintaining two pointers, one for each string, and incrementally appending characters from each string to the result. Once we reach the end of one string, we append the rest of the other string to the result.</description></item><item><title>2215.

Problem Statement Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2. answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1. Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to iterate over each element of the first array and check whether it&amp;rsquo;s in the second array.</description></item><item><title>2839.

Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters. The objective is to find out if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the two strings equal by swapping certain pairs of characters.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try out all possible swap combinations. However, this can be very inefficient, especially when the strings have a large number of characters.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that the swapping condition is quite specific: j - i = 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
