Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is within the range [1, n], you need to find and return the only duplicate number present in nums.
The key constraints:
You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t modify the array nums. You should only use constant extra space. Naive Solution One possible naive solution would be to use a nested loop to compare each element with every other element in the array. This approach, however, is not efficient and has a time complexity of O(n^2), which doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well with large inputs.</description></item><item><title>343.

Problem Statement The problem asks you to divide a given singly linked list into k different parts such that the sizes of these parts are as nearly equal as possible. The parts should appear in the same order as in the original list, and earlier parts should not be smaller than later parts.
Naive Solution A naive approach would involve counting the length of the list and then traversing the list multiple times to create each part.</description></item><item><title>799. Champagne Tower</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/799/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/799/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 799
Problem Statement You are tasked with modeling a champagne tower. Glasses are stacked in a pyramid, with each row having one more glass than the previous. When champagne is poured into the top glass and it overflows, the overflowed champagne is split equally between the two glasses below. The objective is to determine how full a specified glass will be after pouring a given amount of champagne.
Naive Solution One could imagine a simulation, where we pour champagne into the top glass and then, glass-by-glass, simulate the overflow until we reach the desired glass.</description></item><item><title>847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/847/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/847/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 847
Problem Statement Given an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. An array graph is provided where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge. The objective is to determine the length of the shortest path that visits every node.
It&amp;rsquo;s permissible to start and stop at any node, revisit nodes multiple times, and reuse edges.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to attempt all possible paths (brute force) until all nodes are visited.</description></item><item><title>880. Decoded String at Index</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/880/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/880/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 880
Problem Statement Given an encoded string s, the encoded string is transformed into a tape based on the following criteria:
When a letter is encountered, it&amp;rsquo;s written on the tape. When a digit d is encountered, the current content of the tape is repeated d - 1 more times. You are required to find and return the kth letter (1-indexed) on the decoded tape.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution would involve constructing the entire decoded tape and then simply accessing the kth character.</description></item><item><title>1048. Longest String Chain</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1048/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1048/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1048
Problem Statement You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters. Your task is to determine the longest string chain you can form given this list. A word A can be a predecessor of word B if by adding exactly one letter to A (at any position), B is formed. The objective is to find the longest sequence where each word is a predecessor of the next.
Naive Solution The straightforward brute-force way would be to try all possible combinations of word chains.</description></item><item><title>1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1359
Problem Statement You&amp;rsquo;re tasked with finding all valid sequences of pickup and delivery events for n orders such that for every order, the delivery always comes after its respective pickup. Because the answer can be immense, you&amp;rsquo;re to return the result modulo (10^9 + 7).
Naive Solution A straightforward approach might be to generate all potential permutations of pickup and delivery actions and then exclude the unsuitable ones. However, this method would be exceedingly inefficient and would not scale for larger n values.</description></item><item><title>1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1372
Problem Statement Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree. A ZigZag path is defined by a sequence starting at any node and switching between left and right directions at each subsequent step.
Naive Solution A simplistic approach would be to kick off from every node and emulate the ZigZag movement until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer feasible, all the while updating the longest path encountered.</description></item><item><title>1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1658/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1658/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1658
Problem Statement You have an integer array nums and another integer x. In a single operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and decrement x by the value of the removed element. The question is: What is the minimum number of operations required to reduce x to exactly zero? If it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible, the answer should be -1.
Naive Solution The naive approach would be to explore every possible combination of removing elements from the start or the end, recursively.</description></item><item><title>1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1887/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1887/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 1887
Problem Statement The goal of this problem is to make all elements in a given integer array nums equal, through a series of reduction operations. In each operation, we find the largest element in the array, find the next largest element that is strictly smaller than the largest, and reduce the largest element to this next largest value. The task is to return the number of such operations needed to make all array elements equal.</description></item><item><title>2390. Removing Stars From a String</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2390/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2390/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement You are provided with a string s that contains asterisks or stars (*). Your task is to transform this string. In each operation, you&amp;rsquo;ll select a star and remove the character immediately to its left and the star itself. Continue this process until there are no stars left in the string.
The challenge guarantees that the input string can always be transformed as per the given operation, and the result will always be unique.</description></item><item><title>2839. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations I</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2839/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2839/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem
Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters. The objective is to find out if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the two strings equal by swapping certain pairs of characters.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try out all possible swap combinations. However, this can be very inefficient, especially when the strings have a large number of characters.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that the swapping condition is quite specific: j - i = 2.</description></item><item><title>2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2840/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2840/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2840
Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can apply certain operations to make them equal. The question is, is it possible?
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try all possible swap operations and compare the two strings at each step, which would be highly inefficient.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that swapping can only occur at indices i and j where j - i is even.</description></item><item><title>2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2841
