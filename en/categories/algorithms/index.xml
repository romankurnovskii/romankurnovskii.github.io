Palindrome Number
Problem Statement Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution might be to convert the integer to a string and check if it reads the same both ways. However, this challenge encourages solving it without such conversion.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips By reversing the number and comparing it to the original, you can determine if it&amp;rsquo;s a palindrome.
Approach Instead of converting the number to a string, we can reverse its digits using mathematical operations and then compare the reversed number to the original number.</description></item><item><title>1777A - Everybody Likes Good Arrays! - 800</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/02-combinatorics-and-geometry/1777a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/02-combinatorics-and-geometry/1777a/</guid><description>1777A - Everybody Likes Good Arrays!

Logic The equation is a mix of multiplication and exponential operations. Given the nature of exponential operations, $𝑥^𝑦$ and $𝑦^𝑥$ can grow very large very quickly as x and y increase.
We can try to simplify the equation.
If we can somehow set one of the variables x or y to 1, the equation simplifies.

Statement In this problem, we need to find the &amp;ldquo;beauty&amp;rdquo; of all permutations of a certain length n. The beauty of a permutation is defined as the number of inversions in an array that is created by combining the permutation and its reverse.
Logic The key insight is that every permutation of length n has the same beauty.
This is because the structure of the array created by concatenating a permutation with its reverse ensures that there will always be the same number of inversions, regardless of the order of the numbers in the original permutation.</description></item><item><title>1807B - Grab the Candies - 800</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807b/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807b/</guid><description>1807B - Grab the Candies (greedy, 800)

This problem is also known as the Dutch National Flag problem. One solution is to use three pointers to partition the array into three sections: red, white, and blue.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the algorithm:
Initialize three pointers: left, mid, and right. Initialize left to 0, mid to 0, and right to n-1, where n is the length of the input array. While mid is less than or equal to right: If nums[mid] is 0, swap nums[mid] with nums[left], increment mid and left.</description></item><item><title>78.

Naive Solution:
A naive solution would be to generate all possible partitions of the given string and then check if every substring in each partition is a palindrome.
However, this approach would be inefficient, as there would be an exponential number of partitions to check.
Approach:
Using Backtracking.
Logic:
Define a helper function, is_palindrome, to check if a given substring is a palindrome. Define the backtrack function to find all palindrome partitions recursively. This function will take the current position in the string and the current partition as input arguments.</description></item><item><title>134.

Problem Statement You are given a square grid of integers, specifically a 0-indexed n×n matrix named grid. The objective is to determine how many pairs of rows and columns in the grid are identical in terms of their content and order.
To elucidate, if row $r_i$ and column $c_j$ have the same integers in the exact same sequence, they are considered an &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo; pair. The challenge is to count all such pairs in the given matrix.</description></item><item><title>2390.

Problem Statement You are provided with a string s that contains asterisks or stars (*). Your task is to transform this string. In each operation, you&amp;rsquo;ll select a star and remove the character immediately to its left and the star itself. Continue this process until there are no stars left in the string.
The challenge guarantees that the input string can always be transformed as per the given operation, and the result will always be unique.</description></item><item><title>2839.

Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters. The objective is to find out if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the two strings equal by swapping certain pairs of characters.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try out all possible swap combinations. However, this can be very inefficient, especially when the strings have a large number of characters.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that the swapping condition is quite specific: j - i = 2.</description></item><item><title>2840.

Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can apply certain operations to make them equal. The question is, is it possible?
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try all possible swap operations and compare the two strings at each step, which would be highly inefficient.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that swapping can only occur at indices i and j where j - i is even.</description></item><item><title>2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2841
Problem Statement You are given an integer array nums and two positive integers m and k.
The task is to return the maximum sum out of all almost unique subarrays of length k of nums. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
A subarray is almost unique if it contains at least m pairwise distinct elements.
Naive Solution A naive solution would be to generate all the possible subarrays of length k and check each one to see if it is almost unique and what its sum is.</description></item><item><title>2856.

Problem Statement Given a 0-indexed sorted array of integers nums, you can perform a specific operation an unlimited number of times:
Choose two indices, i and j, where i &amp;lt; j and nums[i] &amp;lt; nums[j]. Remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order and the array is re-indexed. The task is to determine and return the smallest possible length of nums after executing the operation as many times as you wish.</description></item><item><title>Contests</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/contests/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/contests/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Round #867/1822 (Div. 3)</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/contests/867-div-3-1822/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/contests/867-div-3-1822/</guid><description>Contest problems A.
