The main objective of today&amp;rsquo;s work was to enhance the abstraction in the classes and improve the overall code structure.
The goal was to make the code more adaptable and easier to maintain.
For example, instead of having Binance hardcoded in the from_binance_order method, now use the Exchanges enum, which makes the code more versatile and ready for additional exchanges in the future.
def from_binance_order(binance_order: BinanceOrder): exchange = Exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Creating a GUI for a Trading Bot</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/003-trading-bot-gui-init-tkinter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/003-trading-bot-gui-init-tkinter/</guid><description>The journey towards creating a light trading bot framework begins with a simple, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). For this venture, I have chosen to rely on Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in Tkinter library to provide the fundamental building blocks for my GUI.
Embracing Simplicity The initial goal is to keep the GUI as straightforward as possible, focusing on the core functionalities required for a trading bot. The main elements incorporated are:
Start/Stop Buttons: These allow the user to control the operation of the bot.</description></item></channel></rss>
