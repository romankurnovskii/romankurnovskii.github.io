Palindrome Number
Problem Statement Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution might be to convert the integer to a string and check if it reads the same both ways. However, this challenge encourages solving it without such conversion.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips By reversing the number and comparing it to the original, you can determine if it&amp;rsquo;s a palindrome.
Approach Instead of converting the number to a string, we can reverse its digits using mathematical operations and then compare the reversed number to the original number.</description></item><item><title>1777A - Everybody Likes Good Arrays! - 800</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/02-combinatorics-and-geometry/1777a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/02-combinatorics-and-geometry/1777a/</guid><description>1777A - Everybody Likes Good Arrays!

A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. Representing a Binary Tree in Python
To represent a binary tree in Python, we can create a class called Node to represent each node in the tree. Each node will have a value and references to its left and right children.
If a node doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a left or right child, the reference will be set to None.</description></item><item><title>Segment Tree</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/data-structures/segment-tree/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/data-structures/segment-tree/</guid><description>A Segment Tree is a data structure used for efficiently processing queries over intervals or ranges. It is commonly used for solving problems that involve finding information about a set of elements and their sub-intervals.
Since a Segment Tree is a binary tree, a simple linear array can be used to represent the Segment Tree. Before building the Segment Tree, one must figure what needs to be stored in the Segment Tree&amp;rsquo;s node?.
Each leaf node represents a single element, and each internal node represents the union of its children&amp;rsquo;s ranges.</description></item><item><title>11.

Logic The equation is a mix of multiplication and exponential operations. Given the nature of exponential operations, $𝑥^𝑦$ and $𝑦^𝑥$ can grow very large very quickly as x and y increase.
We can try to simplify the equation.
If we can somehow set one of the variables x or y to 1, the equation simplifies.
This is because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 1 is the number itself, and any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.</description></item><item><title>1807A - Plus or Minus - 800</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807a/</guid><description>1807A - Plus or Minus (implementation, 800)

Statement In this problem, we need to find the &amp;ldquo;beauty&amp;rdquo; of all permutations of a certain length n. The beauty of a permutation is defined as the number of inversions in an array that is created by combining the permutation and its reverse.
Logic The key insight is that every permutation of length n has the same beauty.
This is because the structure of the array created by concatenating a permutation with its reverse ensures that there will always be the same number of inversions, regardless of the order of the numbers in the original permutation.</description></item><item><title>1807B - Grab the Candies - 800</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807b/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/codeforces/01-implementation-and-greedy/1807b/</guid><description>1807B - Grab the Candies (greedy, 800)

A naive solution would be to generate all possible partitions of the given string and then check if every substring in each partition is a palindrome.
However, this approach would be inefficient, as there would be an exponential number of partitions to check.
Approach:
Using Backtracking.
Logic:
Define a helper function, is_palindrome, to check if a given substring is a palindrome. Define the backtrack function to find all palindrome partitions recursively.

The column titles in an Excel sheet are designed similar to a base-26 number system. The columns start from &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; (which is 1) to &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo; (which is 26), then after &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo;, the column titles go to &amp;lsquo;AA&amp;rsquo; (which is 27), &amp;lsquo;AB&amp;rsquo; (28), and so on.
This problem is essentially asking us to convert a base-26 number (represented by uppercase English letters) to a decimal number.
That means that for each &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; index in columnTitle we already pass alphabet.</description></item><item><title>189.

Problem Statement Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Naive Solution A simple, but inefficient, approach would be to rotate the array k times. In each rotation, we shift every element of the array to the right by one and move the last element to the start of the array. This solution has a time complexity of O(n*k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of rotations.</description></item><item><title>190.

This task involves understanding how binary representation works. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit value, where each bit represents a power of 2, from 2^0 (the least significant bit) to 2^31 (the most significant bit).
Unsigned Integers (often called &amp;ldquo;uints&amp;rdquo;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).
Naive Solution A naive solution to this problem could involve converting the number to a binary string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer.</description></item><item><title>191.

Problem Statement Given an integer value represented in binary format, we need to count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; bits in its binary representation.
Naive Solution The naive solution for this problem would be to convert the binary number into a string and then simply iterate over the string and count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;s. However, this solution is not optimal and is not taking advantage of the properties of binary numbers.
Algorithm The optimal solution for this problem involves using bitwise operation.</description></item><item><title>EC2</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/ec2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/ec2/</guid><description>About AWS EC2 AWS EC2 User Guide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - one of the most popular AWS services.

Problem Statement In this problem, we are given a number n. We have to determine whether this number is a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</description></item><item><title>206.

Problem Statement Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
Naive Solution A simple solution to this problem is to:
traverse the linked list storing the value of each node in an array. Then, we could compare the array with its reversed version.
If they match, the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.
This solution takes O(n) time (where n is the number of nodes in the list), as we need to traverse the list once.</description></item><item><title>238.

Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is within the range [1, n], you need to find and return the only duplicate number present in nums.
The key constraints:
You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t modify the array nums. You should only use constant extra space. Naive Solution One possible naive solution would be to use a nested loop to compare each element with every other element in the array. This approach, however, is not efficient and has a time complexity of O(n^2), which doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well with large inputs.</description></item><item><title>Elastic Beanstalk</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/elasticbeanstalk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/elasticbeanstalk/</guid><description>About AWS Elastic Beanstalk AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

Problem Statement The problem is about finding a greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. The term &amp;ldquo;GCD&amp;rdquo; might be familiar from mathematics, as the largest number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. Here, we extend the idea to strings: a string x is a GCD of strings str1 and str2 if x can be repeatedly appended to itself to obtain str1 and str2.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to find all possible divisors of str1 and str2, and then find the largest common divisor.</description></item><item><title>1207.

Problem Statement Given a string s and an integer k, the task is to return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.
Vowel letters in English are &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo;.
Naive Solution The most straightforward solution to this problem is to take every possible substring of length k and count the number of vowels in each of them. This can be done using nested loops. The outer loop runs through each character in the string while the inner loop counts the vowels for each substring of length k.</description></item><item><title>1493.

Problem Statement Given cars parked on a number line, represented by starting and ending coordinates, we aim to determine the number of points on this line that are covered by any part of these cars.
Naive Solution A basic approach is to simply iterate through each interval and for each interval, iterate through its range, adding each point to a list. Finally, we can return the length of this list to get the total points. However, this approach has a risk of counting points multiple times when two cars overlap.</description></item><item><title>2849.

Start/Stop Buttons: These allow the user to control the operation of the bot.</description></item><item><title>Setup OpenVPN Server on AWS EC2 Ubuntu</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/002-openvpn-aws-ec2-setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/002-openvpn-aws-ec2-setup/</guid><description>Today, I embarked on a journey to create an accessible, affordable, and easy-to-use VPN solution that anyone can set up on their devices using AWS.
Finding a reasonably priced solution was critical. I opted for Amazon&amp;rsquo;s t3a.nano ARM Ubuntu image, which costs ~$0.0047/hour ~ $3.8/month.
Various Amazon EC2 instances and their prices are listed on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s On-Demand Pricing page.
Here is the list of all Ubuntu AMI images to identify the appropriate image for the project. The selected image combined with the CloudFormation template, which was inspired by the AWS CloudFormation General Reference, provides a seamless and consistent user experience.</description></item><item><title>Visualize Algorithms - Rediscovering Backtracking</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/001-rediscovering-backtracking-algo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/stories/001-rediscovering-backtracking-algo/</guid><description>Today, I tackled a LeetCode programming problem that pushed me to rediscover a forgotten concept and devise a creative solution to share my learning experience with others.

Determined to refresh my memory, I set out not only to solve the problem but also to find a way to make it easier for myself and others to visualize and comprehend the algorithm in the future.</description></item><item><title>How to Create a React-Electron Application From Scratch</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/howto-create-react-electron-app-ts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/howto-create-react-electron-app-ts/</guid><description>In this step-by-step tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a simple React-Electron application from scratch.

In order to understand which images we can enhance, we add a separate tag/key/id to those images
Tools To implement the functionality, we need to:
Write/connect a script/handler that will perform the zoomin effect on the images we need Add the necessary metadata to the images, so the script can find them zoomin script To add the ability to zoom on click, we will use the medium-zoom package.</description></item><item><title>Automating Code Reviews with Amazon CodeGuru</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/codeguru/automating-code-reviews-amazon-codeguru/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/aws-certified-developer-associate/codeguru/automating-code-reviews-amazon-codeguru/</guid><description>Lab Automating Code Reviews with Amazon CodeGuru Associating Amazon CodeGuru with a CodeCommit Repository 1.
