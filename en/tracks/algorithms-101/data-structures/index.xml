What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. Representing a Binary Tree in Python
To represent a binary tree in Python, we can create a class called Node to represent each node in the tree. Each node will have a value and references to its left and right children.
If a node doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a left or right child, the reference will be set to None.</description></item><item><title>Segment Tree</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/data-structures/segment-tree/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/data-structures/segment-tree/</guid><description>A Segment Tree is a data structure used for efficiently processing queries over intervals or ranges. It is commonly used for solving problems that involve finding information about a set of elements and their sub-intervals.
Since a Segment Tree is a binary tree, a simple linear array can be used to represent the Segment Tree. Before building the Segment Tree, one must figure what needs to be stored in the Segment Tree&amp;rsquo;s node?.
Each leaf node represents a single element, and each internal node represents the union of its children&amp;rsquo;s ranges.</description></item></channel></rss>
