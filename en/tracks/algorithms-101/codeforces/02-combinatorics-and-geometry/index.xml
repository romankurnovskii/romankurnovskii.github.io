(greedy, math, 800)
Statement:
You have an array of numbers, and you want to make it &amp;ldquo;good.&amp;rdquo; A good array is one where every pair of adjacent numbers has different parity (one is even, and the other is odd). You can do this by performing operations on pairs of adjacent numbers with the same parity (both even or both odd), and replacing them with their product. Logic:
Loop through the array Check the parity of the current element and the previous element If the parity is the same, perform the operation and increment the operation counter Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the array Return the operation counter Solution:</description></item></channel></rss>
