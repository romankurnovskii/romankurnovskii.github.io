The problem centered around a backtracking algorithm. Although I had previously explored this topic, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite remember the exact steps and logic involved. Determined to refresh my memory, I set out not only to solve the problem but also to find a way to make it easier for myself and others to visualize and comprehend the algorithm in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
