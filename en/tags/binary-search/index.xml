Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
Example 1:
Input: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2. Example 2:
Input: x = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.</description></item><item><title>2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/2251/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/2251/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2251
Problem Statement In the given problem, we are presented with two arrays. The first, flowers, represents when each flower starts and stops being in full bloom. The second, people, indicates when each person arrives to see the flowers. Our task is to determine, for each person, how many flowers they will see in full bloom upon their arrival.
Naive Solution A straightforward approach might involve iterating over each person&amp;rsquo;s arrival time. For each time, we could iterate over the flowers list to count how many flowers are in full bloom.</description></item></channel></rss>
