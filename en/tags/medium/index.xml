Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2 Output: [1,2,3,5] Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1 Output: [] Idea:
Two pointers. Second pointer starts from nth position. Run while second pointer exist. First version:

Maximum Product Subarray</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/152/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/152/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement In this problem, we&amp;rsquo;re given an integer array nums, and our task is to find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. The interesting part of this problem is that the array can contain both positive and negative numbers, so the maximum product can be obtained by a subarray ending at any index of the array.
Naive Solution A naive approach to this problem would be to calculate the product of all possible subarrays and return the maximum one.</description></item><item><title>166.

Problem Statement Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format. If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
This problem is about converting a fraction to its decimal representation in string format. The tricky part is dealing with repeating decimals. If a decimal repeats, we should enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
For example, if we have a fraction 1/3, the decimal representation would be 0.</description></item><item><title>189. Rotate Array</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/189/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/189/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Naive Solution A simple, but inefficient, approach would be to rotate the array k times. In each rotation, we shift every element of the array to the right by one and move the last element to the start of the array. This solution has a time complexity of O(n*k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of rotations.</description></item><item><title>735.

Problem Statement Imagine a row of asteroids moving in space. Each asteroid has a size (given by its absolute value) and a direction it&amp;rsquo;s moving in (given by its sign: positive for right, negative for left). All asteroids move at the same speed. Your task is to determine the final state of the asteroids after all collisions have been resolved.
Two important points to note:
When two asteroids of different directions meet, the smaller one explodes. If they are of the same size, both explode.</description></item><item><title>1004.

Problem Statement Given a binary array nums and an integer k, the task is to return the maximum number of consecutive 1&amp;rsquo;s in the array, with the possibility to flip at most k 0&amp;rsquo;s.
Naive Solution A straight forward approach is to try flipping every combination of k zeros and checking for the longest sequence of 1&amp;rsquo;s. This would involve nested loops, with the outer loop iterating through the array and the inner loops flipping zeros and calculating sequences of 1&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1456/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1456/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 1456
Problem Statement Given a string s and an integer k, the task is to return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.
Vowel letters in English are &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo;.
Naive Solution The most straightforward solution to this problem is to take every possible substring of length k and count the number of vowels in each of them. This can be done using nested loops. The outer loop runs through each character in the string while the inner loop counts the vowels for each substring of length k.</description></item><item><title>1493.

Problem Statement Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it. The goal is to return the size of the longest subarray containing only 1&amp;rsquo;s after this deletion. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
Naive Solution A straightforward approach is to manually try deleting each element in the array and checking the length of the longest sequence of 1&amp;rsquo;s. This would involve nested loops: an outer loop for deleting an element and an inner loop to check sequences of 1&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>2352.

Problem Statement You are given a square grid of integers, specifically a 0-indexed n×n matrix named grid. The objective is to determine how many pairs of rows and columns in the grid are identical in terms of their content and order.
To elucidate, if row $r_i$ and column $c_j$ have the same integers in the exact same sequence, they are considered an &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo; pair. The challenge is to count all such pairs in the given matrix.</description></item><item><title>2390.

Problem Statement You are provided with a string s that contains asterisks or stars (*). Your task is to transform this string. In each operation, you&amp;rsquo;ll select a star and remove the character immediately to its left and the star itself. Continue this process until there are no stars left in the string.
The challenge guarantees that the input string can always be transformed as per the given operation, and the result will always be unique.</description></item></channel></rss>
