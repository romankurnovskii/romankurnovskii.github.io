Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters. The objective is to find out if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the two strings equal by swapping certain pairs of characters.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try out all possible swap combinations. However, this can be very inefficient, especially when the strings have a large number of characters.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that the swapping condition is quite specific: j - i = 2.</description></item><item><title>2840.

Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can apply certain operations to make them equal. The question is, is it possible?
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try all possible swap operations and compare the two strings at each step, which would be highly inefficient.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that swapping can only occur at indices i and j where j - i is even.</description></item><item><title>2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2841
Problem Statement You are given an integer array nums and two positive integers m and k.
The task is to return the maximum sum out of all almost unique subarrays of length k of nums. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
A subarray is almost unique if it contains at least m pairwise distinct elements.
Naive Solution A naive solution would be to generate all the possible subarrays of length k and check each one to see if it is almost unique and what its sum is.</description></item><item><title>2842. Count K-Subsequences of a String with Maximum Beauty</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/2842/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/2842/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement You are given a string s and an integer k. A k-subsequence is a subsequence of s, having length k, and all its characters are unique. The beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence. Here, f(c) denotes the number of times the character c occurs in s.
The task is to find the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is maximum among all k-subsequences. Return the answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.</description></item></channel></rss>
