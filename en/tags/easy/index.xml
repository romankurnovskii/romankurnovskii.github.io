Problem Statement Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
Naive Solution A straightforward solution might be to convert the integer to a string and check if it reads the same both ways. However, this challenge encourages solving it without such conversion.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips By reversing the number and comparing it to the original, you can determine if it&amp;rsquo;s a palindrome.
Approach Instead of converting the number to a string, we can reverse its digits using mathematical operations and then compare the reversed number to the original number.</description></item><item><title>202. Happy Number</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/202/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/202/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement In this problem, we are given a number n. We have to determine whether this number is a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</description></item><item><title>605. Can Place Flowers</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/605/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/605/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 605
In this problem, we are given a flowerbed represented by an integer array flowerbed, where 0 represents an empty plot and 1 represents a plot with a flower.
We need to determine if we can plant n new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the rule that no two adjacent plots can have flowers.
Naive Solution To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the flowerbed and check each plot. If a plot is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty, we can plant a flower in that plot.</description></item><item><title>643. Maximum Average Subarray I</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/643/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/643/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an integer array nums consisting of n elements and an integer k, find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. The result must be accurate up to a decimal point of 10^(-5).
Naive Solution A straightforward approach would be to calculate the average for every possible subarray of length k. For each starting point, sum the next k numbers and determine the average.</description></item><item><title>724. Find Pivot Index</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums, the task is to calculate the pivot index of this array. The pivot index is defined as the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index&amp;rsquo;s right. If no such index exists, return -1.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to iterate over each index and for each index, calculate the sum of elements to the left and right of the index.</description></item><item><title>1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/1071/1071/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/1071/1071/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement The problem is about finding a greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. The term &amp;ldquo;GCD&amp;rdquo; might be familiar from mathematics, as the largest number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. Here, we extend the idea to strings: a string x is a GCD of strings str1 and str2 if x can be repeatedly appended to itself to obtain str1 and str2.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to find all possible divisors of str1 and str2, and then find the largest common divisor.</description></item><item><title>1431.

Problem Statement The problem requires us to find out which kids can potentially have the greatest number of candies if they are given all the extra candies. The information about the number of candies each kid has and the number of extra candies available is given.
Naive Solution A naive approach to this problem would be to iterate over the candies array for each kid and check if adding the extra candies to the kid&amp;rsquo;s current candies makes it equal to or greater than the maximum candies any kid has.</description></item><item><title>1768.

Problem Statement The task is to merge two strings alternately, i.e., take one character from the first string, then one from the second, then again from the first, and so on. If one string finishes before the other, the remaining characters from the longer string are appended at the end.
Naive Solution A naive approach could involve maintaining two pointers, one for each string, and incrementally appending characters from each string to the result. Once we reach the end of one string, we append the rest of the other string to the result.</description></item></channel></rss>
