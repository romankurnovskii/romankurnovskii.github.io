Fraction to Recurring Decimal</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/166/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/166/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 166
Problem Statement Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format. If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
This problem is about converting a fraction to its decimal representation in string format. The tricky part is dealing with repeating decimals. If a decimal repeats, we should enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
For example, if we have a fraction 1/3, the decimal representation would be 0.</description></item><item><title>190. Reverse Bits</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/190/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/190/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
This task involves understanding how binary representation works. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit value, where each bit represents a power of 2, from 2^0 (the least significant bit) to 2^31 (the most significant bit).
Unsigned Integers (often called &amp;ldquo;uints&amp;rdquo;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).
Naive Solution A naive solution to this problem could involve converting the number to a binary string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer.</description></item><item><title>191. Number of 1 Bits</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/191/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/191/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an integer value represented in binary format, we need to count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; bits in its binary representation.
Naive Solution The naive solution for this problem would be to convert the binary number into a string and then simply iterate over the string and count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;s. However, this solution is not optimal and is not taking advantage of the properties of binary numbers.
Algorithm The optimal solution for this problem involves using bitwise operation.</description></item><item><title>202. Happy Number</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/202/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/202/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement In this problem, we are given a number n. We have to determine whether this number is a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</description></item><item><title>283.

Problem Statement The problem is asking to move all zeros in an integer array to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Naive Solution A naive solution could be to create a new list, iterate over the array, add non-zero elements to the new list and count zero elements. Then extend the new list with the same amount of zeros as counted.</description></item><item><title>332. Reconstruct Itinerary</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/332/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/332/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from &amp;ldquo;JFK&amp;rdquo;, thus, the itinerary must begin with &amp;ldquo;JFK&amp;rdquo;. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
Naive Solution One naive solution would be to use backtracking and try all possible combinations of tickets to form a valid itinerary.</description></item><item><title>724. Find Pivot Index</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums, the task is to calculate the pivot index of this array. The pivot index is defined as the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index&amp;rsquo;s right. If no such index exists, return -1.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to iterate over each index and for each index, calculate the sum of elements to the left and right of the index.</description></item><item><title>725. Split Linked List in Parts</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/725/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/725/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 725
Problem Statement The problem asks you to divide a given singly linked list into k different parts such that the sizes of these parts are as nearly equal as possible. The parts should appear in the same order as in the original list, and earlier parts should not be smaller than later parts.
Naive Solution A naive approach would involve counting the length of the list and then traversing the list multiple times to create each part.</description></item><item><title>1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1359
Problem Statement You&amp;rsquo;re tasked with finding all valid sequences of pickup and delivery events for n orders such that for every order, the delivery always comes after its respective pickup. Because the answer can be immense, you&amp;rsquo;re to return the result modulo (10^9 + 7).
Naive Solution A straightforward approach might be to generate all potential permutations of pickup and delivery actions and then exclude the unsuitable ones. However, this method would be exceedingly inefficient and would not scale for larger n values.</description></item><item><title>1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1372
Problem Statement Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree. A ZigZag path is defined by a sequence starting at any node and switching between left and right directions at each subsequent step.
Naive Solution A simplistic approach would be to kick off from every node and emulate the ZigZag movement until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer feasible, all the while updating the longest path encountered.</description></item><item><title>2352. Equal Row and Column Pairs</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2352/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2352/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 2352
Problem Statement You are given a square grid of integers, specifically a 0-indexed n×n matrix named grid. The objective is to determine how many pairs of rows and columns in the grid are identical in terms of their content and order.
To elucidate, if row $r_i$ and column $c_j$ have the same integers in the exact same sequence, they are considered an &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo; pair. The challenge is to count all such pairs in the given matrix.</description></item><item><title>2839. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations I</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2839/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2839/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem
Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters. The objective is to find out if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the two strings equal by swapping certain pairs of characters.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try out all possible swap combinations. However, this can be very inefficient, especially when the strings have a large number of characters.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that the swapping condition is quite specific: j - i = 2.</description></item><item><title>2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2840/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2840/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2840
Problem Statement You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can apply certain operations to make them equal. The question is, is it possible?
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to try all possible swap operations and compare the two strings at each step, which would be highly inefficient.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips Observe that swapping can only occur at indices i and j where j - i is even.</description></item><item><title>2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2841/</guid><description>LeetCode Problem 2841
Problem Statement You are given an integer array nums and two positive integers m and k.
The task is to return the maximum sum out of all almost unique subarrays of length k of nums. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
A subarray is almost unique if it contains at least m pairwise distinct elements.
Naive Solution A naive solution would be to generate all the possible subarrays of length k and check each one to see if it is almost unique and what its sum is.</description></item><item><title>2844. Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2844/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2844/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 2844
Problem Statement You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer. In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special. An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.
Naive Solution A naive approach to solving this problem might involve recursively generating all possible substrings of the input string, checking each one for divisibility by 25.</description></item><item><title>2848. Points That Intersect With Cars</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2848/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/2848/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 2848
Problem Statement Given cars parked on a number line, represented by starting and ending coordinates, we aim to determine the number of points on this line that are covered by any part of these cars.
Naive Solution A basic approach is to simply iterate through each interval and for each interval, iterate through its range, adding each point to a list. Finally, we can return the length of this list to get the total points. However, this approach has a risk of counting points multiple times when two cars overlap.</description></item><item><title>2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2849/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2849/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 2849
Problem Statement You are given starting coordinates (sx, sy) and final coordinates (fx, fy) on a 2D infinite grid. Starting from the initial position, you can move to any of the 8 adjacent cells in one second. The challenge is to determine if you can reach the final cell (fx, fy) in exactly t seconds.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to use a recursive function to navigate the grid from the starting point (sx, sy) and attempt to reach the target (fx, fy) in t seconds.</description></item><item><title>2856. Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2856/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/2856/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given a 0-indexed sorted array of integers nums, you can perform a specific operation an unlimited number of times:
Choose two indices, i and j, where i &amp;lt; j and nums[i] &amp;lt; nums[j]. Remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order and the array is re-indexed. The task is to determine and return the smallest possible length of nums after executing the operation as many times as you wish.</description></item></channel></rss>
