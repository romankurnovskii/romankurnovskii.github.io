Problem Statement Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format. If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
This problem is about converting a fraction to its decimal representation in string format. The tricky part is dealing with repeating decimals. If a decimal repeats, we should enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
For example, if we have a fraction 1/3, the decimal representation would be 0.</description></item><item><title>190. Reverse Bits</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/190/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/190/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
This task involves understanding how binary representation works. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit value, where each bit represents a power of 2, from 2^0 (the least significant bit) to 2^31 (the most significant bit).
Unsigned Integers (often called &amp;ldquo;uints&amp;rdquo;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).
Naive Solution A naive solution to this problem could involve converting the number to a binary string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer.</description></item><item><title>191.

Problem Statement Given an integer value represented in binary format, we need to count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; bits in its binary representation.
Naive Solution The naive solution for this problem would be to convert the binary number into a string and then simply iterate over the string and count the number of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;s. However, this solution is not optimal and is not taking advantage of the properties of binary numbers.
Algorithm The optimal solution for this problem involves using bitwise operation.</description></item><item><title>202.

Problem Statement In this problem, we are given a number n. We have to determine whether this number is a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; number or not. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</description></item><item><title>229.

Problem Statement Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
Naive Solution The immediate solution would involve using a hashmap or dictionary to track the occurrence of each number in the array. After which, we can iterate over the dictionary to find numbers whose occurrences are greater than n/3.
Hints &amp;amp; Tips There can be at most one or two majority elements which appear more than n/3 times in the array.</description></item><item><title>283.

Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is within the range [1, n], you need to find and return the only duplicate number present in nums.
The key constraints:
You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t modify the array nums. You should only use constant extra space. Naive Solution One possible naive solution would be to use a nested loop to compare each element with every other element in the array. This approach, however, is not efficient and has a time complexity of O(n^2), which doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well with large inputs.</description></item><item><title>332.

Problem Statement Given two strings s and t, the string t is generated by shuffling the characters of s and adding one additional character at a random position. The task is to identify and return that extra character.
Naive Solution A naive solution would involve comparing the characters in both strings one by one to detect the extra character in t. This method is not efficient as it could take a linear amount of time for strings of considerable lengths.</description></item><item><title>724. Find Pivot Index</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/easy/724/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
Problem Statement Given an array of integers nums, the task is to calculate the pivot index of this array. The pivot index is defined as the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index&amp;rsquo;s right. If no such index exists, return -1.
Naive Solution A naive approach would be to iterate over each index and for each index, calculate the sum of elements to the left and right of the index.</description></item><item><title>725. Split Linked List in Parts</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/725/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/725/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 725
Problem Statement The problem asks you to divide a given singly linked list into k different parts such that the sizes of these parts are as nearly equal as possible. The parts should appear in the same order as in the original list, and earlier parts should not be smaller than later parts.
Naive Solution A naive approach would involve counting the length of the list and then traversing the list multiple times to create each part.</description></item><item><title>799. Champagne Tower</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/799/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/799/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 799
Problem Statement You are tasked with modeling a champagne tower. Glasses are stacked in a pyramid, with each row having one more glass than the previous. When champagne is poured into the top glass and it overflows, the overflowed champagne is split equally between the two glasses below. The objective is to determine how full a specified glass will be after pouring a given amount of champagne.
Naive Solution One could imagine a simulation, where we pour champagne into the top glass and then, glass-by-glass, simulate the overflow until we reach the desired glass.</description></item><item><title>847.

Naive Solution A straightforward solution would involve constructing the entire decoded tape and then simply accessing the kth character.</description></item><item><title>1048. Longest String Chain</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1048/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1048/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1048
Problem Statement You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters. Your task is to determine the longest string chain you can form given this list. A word A can be a predecessor of word B if by adding exactly one letter to A (at any position), B is formed. The objective is to find the longest sequence where each word is a predecessor of the next.
Naive Solution The straightforward brute-force way would be to try all possible combinations of word chains.</description></item><item><title>1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/hard/1359/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1359
Problem Statement You&amp;rsquo;re tasked with finding all valid sequences of pickup and delivery events for n orders such that for every order, the delivery always comes after its respective pickup. Because the answer can be immense, you&amp;rsquo;re to return the result modulo (10^9 + 7).
Naive Solution A straightforward approach might be to generate all potential permutations of pickup and delivery actions and then exclude the unsuitable ones. However, this method would be exceedingly inefficient and would not scale for larger n values.</description></item><item><title>1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/1372/</guid><description>LeetCode problem 1372
Problem Statement Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree. A ZigZag path is defined by a sequence starting at any node and switching between left and right directions at each subsequent step.
Naive Solution A simplistic approach would be to kick off from every node and emulate the ZigZag movement until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer feasible, all the while updating the longest path encountered.</description></item><item><title>1420.

Problem Statement Given cars parked on a number line, represented by starting and ending coordinates, we aim to determine the number of points on this line that are covered by any part of these cars.
Naive Solution A basic approach is to simply iterate through each interval and for each interval, iterate through its range, adding each point to a list. Finally, we can return the length of this list to get the total points. However, this approach has a risk of counting points multiple times when two cars overlap.</description></item><item><title>2849.
