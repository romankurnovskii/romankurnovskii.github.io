Calculating Formula SMA = (Sum of price data for the last N periods) / N
For example, a 5-period SMA would sum up the last 5 closing prices and divide it by 5 to find the average. It is called a &amp;lsquo;moving&amp;rsquo; average because as new prices become available, the oldest prices are dropped and the average recalculates.</description></item><item><title>EMA - Exponential Moving Average</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/ema/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/ema/</guid><description>About Unlike the SMA, the EMA gives more weight to recent data, making it quicker to respond to price changes.
Calculating Formula EMA = (Close - Previous EMA) * Multiplier + Previous EMA
Where:
Close: the closing price for a given period (Price today/now). Here close prices is for example N: the period of the EMA. Multiplier: 2 / (N + 1) Previous EMA is the EMA of the previous period. The EMA for the first period is just the Close price.</description></item><item><title>MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/macd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/macd/</guid><description>About The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a versatile trading indicator used in various forms of trading, including high-frequency trading (HFT).
MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
Calculating Formula The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the &amp;ldquo;signal line&amp;rdquo;, is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.</description></item><item><title>RSI - Relative Strength Index</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/rsi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/posts/trading-indicators/rsi/</guid><description>About The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the RSI is a very popular indicator that is used primarily to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a market.
Calculating The RSI is calculated using the following steps:
Calculate the average gain and the average loss over the specified period (usually 14 periods). Compute the relative strength (RS) which is the ratio of average gain to average loss.</description></item></channel></rss>
