Problem Statement The problem involves an array of integers height, where each element represents the height of a line. These lines, along with the x-axis, form a series of containers. Your goal is to find the two lines that form the container with the greatest area.
Naive Solution The naive solution is to consider all pairs of lines and calculate the area of water each pair can contain. You would keep track of the maximum area encountered.</description></item><item><title>55.

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array&amp;rsquo;s first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4] Output: true Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4] Output: false Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what.</description></item><item><title>122.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach.
The idea is to keep adding the profit whenever the price on the next day is higher than the price on the current day.
This way, we will maximize profit.
class Solution: def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -&amp;gt; int: profit = 0 for i in range(1, len(prices)): if prices[i] &amp;gt; prices[i - 1]: profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1] return profit LeetCode Editorial:

Naive Solution:
A naive solution would be to try starting from each gas station and check if you can complete the circuit. For each gas station, calculate the remaining gas in the tank after traveling to the next station.
If the gas is not enough to travel to the next station, stop and try starting from the next gas station.
Approach:
In this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm
We can keep track of the total gas and total cost while iterating through the gas stations.</description></item><item><title>138. Copy List with Random Pointer</title><link>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/138/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romankurnovskii.com/en/tracks/algorithms-101/leetcode/medium/138/</guid><description>LeetCode problem
The problem asks to create a deep copy of a given linked list with a random pointer in each node. A deep copy means that the new linked list will have completely new nodes, and none of its pointers should point to the nodes in the original list. Both the next and random pointers of the new nodes should point to the new nodes in the copied list in the same order as the original list.</description></item></channel></rss>
